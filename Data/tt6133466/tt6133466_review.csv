A painful way to spend your time,,4.0,6 February 2020
"Weakest of The Purge films, but it remains a flawed but fascinating franchise","This fourth installment in the fascinating, but flawed dystopian franchise, does succeed in begin exciting and never boring, but as with the prior films remains a disappointment considering the awesome and frightening premiss. However, in this film's favor, it does fill in some of the logic gaps of the previous films, answering some persistent lingering questions in this prequel of the first ever limited Purge on Staton Island, Are people really so depraved to go on killing rampages one day a year? How could the economy and crime rates improve as a result of a yearly purge? Who would benefit from such an event? Much is explained in this installment. The totalitarian New Founding Fathers need this first purge to be a success, so when the brown and poverty stricken residents of Staten Island don't riot and kill, they send in a Blackwater type of group to make sure there are plenty of killings in hopes of turning citizens against one another. When the leader of the Blackwater group is a dead ringer or Ronny Regan, it's not hard to guess where this film's politics lie and the filmmakers opinion of our current president and his divisive style of politics for personal enrichment (At one point, the heroine refers to one of her attackers as a ""pussy-grabber,"" a pretty direct Trump reference.). As with the other films, this one follows a disparate group of folks trying to survive the 12-hour Purge, primarily an anti-purge activist and a community minded drug kingpin. The downside to this film is similar to the others, in that there is not a lot of character development and despite a strong film concept and story set-up, the film quickly devolves into a series of action set pieces. I found this to be the weakest of the series when it came to action and suspense, but it's likely the strongest when it comes to better fleshing out the politics and the logic behind the purge. I'm also disappointed that the series is straying pretty significantly from it's horror roots in the first film and is more and more becoming an urban action film series. The first two films did an excellent job of conveying the frightening anarchy of the purge (the first film was a straight-up horror home invasion story), but subsequent films has felt more action oriented. I much preferred the uncompromising horror of the first films, which seemed to delve more into the darkness of human nature, even if the logic of the purge was less intelligible. Series creator James DeMonaco is only the writer this time and leaves the directing duties to Gerard McMurray, who does a serviceable job, but this film felt less apocalyptic and less surreal than the prior films, somewhat to it's detriment. After having watched this film and having started watching the 10 episode TV event, I think The Purge series needs to either become more political (which this film did more so) or more focused on simply presenting interesting scenarios and chaos (which the TV show is doing more of), but I keep feeling like there's not enough of either in any of these films.",6.0,1 October 2018
"Had Potential, Falls short",,5.0,4 July 2018
Worst Purge movie out of all of them,"The characters are underdeveloped and the acting is bad, which made me indifferent whether they survived or not. There is no real suspense, only random action scenes. Lastly, the ""scientific layer"" they tried to add, and the stereotypes, are just insulting to the viewer.",3.0,24 July 2021
Really amusing movie.,"I haven't seen the original Purge movies. And because this is a prequel, I just went to see it having 0 expectations. This movie has some GREAT actors (which make you notice some terrible acting from others). Still an amazing concept for a movie and I just really enjoyed it. Heard some negative sounds here and there. But everyone's a critic these days and that probably stops them from turning off your brain and just enjoy a movie. If you haven't seen the others than go see it! It's just good fun.",7.0,4 August 2018
Sigh...what a waste of potential,"It's a dreadful bore, with poor writing, and an incredibly forced depiction of the Black side of this fictional movement. Everything the film tries to start anew feels so out of place and none of it amounts to anything remotely interesting, while everything else feels like a forced tie in product to the other films before it, never directly addressing them, but largely relying on similar setups and situations that the other ones have already dealt with. The acting is incredibly over the top, the screenplay even more so, never knowing what it quite wants to be or wants to say. The direction is harsh, the tone and look of the film bleak, and it never decides on whether it wants to be a trip to empowerment or a social commentary, both of which the film pulls off poorly. The music is forced, the characters thin, and I can't think of many things positive about the film besides potential that the film so poorly executed. In the end, The First Purge is not only a pointless sequel, but a truly lackluster film, with no agenda but to accumulate some more money for this seemingly never ending franchise. My Rating: 2.5/10",1.0,31 January 2021
A Solid if Imperfect Prequel,"Many of these IMDb users are hatin' on this movie simply because they look at that screen and don't see faces/characters/situations that they can relate to. That's fine because that's going to be true for most audiences, but by no means does that make this a bad movie. It just means this movie wasn't made for them.

It was made for people who can relate to the obvious real-life metaphors this film hits on: financial desperation, a scarily-real governmental turn toward autocracy under-girded by racism and exploitation of the urban poor, and the unpredictable spasms of people who REALLY ARE losing it in these tumultuous times.

The plot and story are no less solid than the simplicity of the other films: a menagerie of characters looking to survive the night, with their own agendas, despite structural forces at work against and unknown to them.

Yet, what mass American audience wants to identify with a drug-dealer-turned-urban-Rambo in the main action hero Dmitri (Y'lan Noel)? The catharsis of all movies (but especially dystopian films because of the creepy sub-textual realism) is in getting absorbed emotionally into relatable characters. Most audiences can't relate to Dmitri or Nya (Lex Scott Davis). Those familiar with the hood can; or at least those that can imagine that perspective.

In that sense, The First Purge veers toward Blaxploitation, and it's un-apologetic about it. Yet the sight of Neo-Nazis going door-to-door in legal extermination IS actually terrifying as real-life white supremacists emboldenment across the country is encouraged by autocratic fervor.

As far as dystopian sci-fi goes, we're far closer to that possibility than most audiences want or can imagine. That's part of what makes this film compelling if not technically as slick as the others (which IS admittedly disappointing given a bigger budget than the last).

The last film, Election Year began the politics of the series; with upwards of $80 million gross on a $10 million budget, a politics most audiences had little problem with.

This film is a logical (in a prequel kind of way) next step in the obvious political turn the series took in the last film, only the perspective turns the lens primarily on the plight of the urban poor and criminally enterprising and those in power manipulating things behind the scenes. As for the hood perspective, you're not seeing ""bad acting"" as some users have accused. It's acting and being that doesn't give a s#!% what outsiders of the hood perspective think.

If you want to see credibly-creepy dystopian fair that's all-too-close to home--and if you're willing to identify with life on the other side of the tracks--this movie is worth a look, but don't expect the stylistic slickness of the other films.

The First Purge is very low-fi compared to the others, but that doesn't make it low-worth. Only those who can't wipe away their lenses for a couple of hours would think that of an otherwise solid movie.",7.0,10 August 2018
Awful movie,,1.0,14 July 2018
Go in knowing what you're watching,"It's not a terrible film, but also not a great film. Go in expecting the same as the last two films (not the first film, that was a completely different type of movie)",6.0,4 July 2018
Horrible,,1.0,5 July 2018
Movie was the best of the purge series,"I do not understand why everyone is hating on this movie so much. I believe the writer did a great job in including todays society in this movie. People will do anything they have to now days to make money to support their families, even kill, legal or not. The government does pray on the poor and poverty level in society, and the only people that think differently are the ones privileged enough to never have to go through it.

People are hating on this movie because they believe a certain way about politics these days and do not want to see anything that depicts the real truth. The truth hurts as they say and its hurting a lot of peoples feelings.

This movie is a must see for those who have enjoyed seeing the growth in the films over the years. It is suspenseful and action packed like the other ones have been and has a great story line behind it all. It was definitely worth the money I paid to go see it and I would actually see it again.",8.0,11 July 2018

"Boring, Race-baiting, Dumpster Fire",,1.0,26 March 2019
Political divide,"If you actually think this movie will divide America further ... I've got news for you: that's not possible. Was I surprised how much they packed in, when it comes to political references and hints and messages (not even really hidden ones) to the current state? You better believe that I was. I did think that it might hurt the movie because people do try to escape when watching a movie not really wanting to see something they see on their news channel all day anyway.

But since it was action packed, maybe it could have worked. Seems like it didn't. Some will like it, some will hate it. But it won't convince either side to communicate more with each other. Which just to be clear is not the movies fault! Don't put that on the movie. It still has the premise we ""loved"" in the movie series which will obviously carry over to the TV show. And it works, if you let it and can see past the ""agenda"" or are with it anyway ... The criticism is there and to be honest, it doesn't seem that far fetched or stretched ... especially with some quotes almost being exact to those in real life ...",6.0,18 October 2018
"Horrible, racist garbage",In the movie all white people are bad and black people are incapable of success unless they deal drugs and the rest need to survive on government handouts that are only paid to them if they commit crimes. Racist trash! Just about insulting to everyone. The film makers should be ashamed of themselves. Thankfully there are smart film makers who show many different diverse cast members in movies where they portray successful and inspiring characters,1.0,5 September 2020
Unfairly bashed,"If you like the previous movies (though anarchy was the best and the rest aren't that good), then you'll like this too.",7.0,15 October 2018
Time to purge the purge,This film was embarrassing like a straight to video flick from 2003. There was nothing remotely interesting about it. It was corny and It had outdated racial stereotypes which frankly I found offensive.,1.0,5 June 2020
Not as bad as described in the comments,"First, this is pure fiction. The universe is known and you have to willing to suspense your disbelief. Second, it's leftist and quite manichean (Poor Vs Rich) But like 99,9% of Hollywood production. Diversity is ""good"", white is trash. Third, this is a action packed/dystopian/slasher movie. Don't expect anything else.",7.0,21 September 2018
Absolutely Awful,"Was this movie written for 7 year olds? The plot, from the beginning, was incredibly poor and the storyline development just got worse and worse all the way to the end. ""Make way for the King...""?? Really? The drug dealer who became rich exploiting his own ghetto community is now the King? The hypocrisy of these types of films are so blatant it says a lot about people who enjoy this trash. Do NOT waste your money on this film.",1.0,4 July 2018

Terrible movie,,1.0,23 August 2021
Absolute Garbage.,"My expectations going into be movie were impeccably low, however, apparently, they were not low enough. Do not go into this movie expecting a thorough back story to the beginnings of the purge. Instead, expect a very short glimpse of the beginnings, which is followed by simply another purge movie, that is just worse. I debated leaving halfway through, but I remembered I payed 6 dollars to watch it, and I went with 2 other people. Please save your money, and don't go or rent this trash.",1.0,11 July 2018
Cheap Fun,"For the record I'm not going to begin this review by defending my score with something like: it's not intended to be clever, well written, e.t.c. I don't believe it's ok to give horror films, like this, a free pass, because they're geared towards a mainstream audience who don't want to indulge in to much social commentary, and would rather mindlessly watch a multitude of characters die gruesome deaths.

With that out of the way... I was pleasantly surprised by The First Purge, to me it felt as if they'd learnt their lesson from their last two installments and decided to go back to basics, a concentrated event that isn't over bloated by showing the audience multiple different Purge scenarios. Therefore, I found it much more entertaining, because it felt like this one had direction, a real message, rather than being a sizzle-reel of murders with plot tied in just to explain how the characters got from one place to another. As always the action was entertaining and creative, so for the most part there isn't really anything to complain about there and where former complaints lied, from the other movies, like choice of music, or stylistic choices were also surprisingly great.

I do have a few complaints: The pacing of this installment is slower than the others, largely because there's the set up of how the Purge began, but it's noticeable enough to be enjoying. I also found the dialogue very unrealistic and it made me cringe many times throughout the film; it's very noticeable that the 'hood' (black) dialogue was written by someone who has no experience with the way black people in tower block communities, and unsurprisingly it was written by someone who isn't black them self. Occasionally, a few characters felt generic, with their goals and background/personality, but it was something that didn't take me out of the experience, so it weren't detrimental, but it was still noticeable. Overall, my complaints this time round felt quite minor and in know severely impacted my experience of the film.

It was a riot of a time from start to end, and that's why I've given The First Purge a 7/10.

Side Note: My opinions of the movie may be exasperated, due to my expectations going in, and my taste in general. However, one things for sure if you like senseless violence, and well choreographed action, I can guarantee you'll at least be satisfied by the price of admission.",7.0,4 July 2018
This is NOT a purge film,"It really is a shame they have ruined these films, by far the worst one they have made. The first 3 are amazing but I wouldn't waste my time or money watching this again. 1 local drug dealer takes on and beats the whole.",2.0,28 September 2019
What we see....,"Those of us outside the US can see that this is a potential reality. I didn't see this and exploitation of the black community at all. It showed their solidarity and community. Y'lan Noel was excellent. Some of the script and directional choices were a little off, but I've seen worse in the blockbuster Avengers types of movies. So what!? This is ridiculous 'torture p**n', so low standards are expected! Haha",7.0,6 October 2018
Not A Good Movie,"I cannot believe how bad this was , I have not seen such a bad effort at writing , directing and acting for a while .

When I start to watch a movie , I will see it through, even if I hate it .

Nothing new about human race.,"Another film about how vile people can be, to whom everything is allowed.

The original Purge was such Unique thriller....how did they let it become so bad...,,1.0,9 July 2018
I enjoyed it on the big screen,"Fourth film in the franchise here we have the prequal explaining the thinking behind and start of the experiment on Staten Island known as The Purge, where all crime is allowed over a 12 hour period. The reason behind the Purge is far right wing politics, no doubt a comment on the current political climate, but it doesn't get too heavy regarding the film itself. This is one of the movies that requires little thinking, just put your brain into neutral and enjoy the action. Of which there is plenty. Good banging soundtrack, acting is good enough. My favourite character was a pyscho known as Skeletor, who's face required no mask. He'd not look out of place in a slasher movie. Things do get a bit too far fetched with a one man army taking on the militia but I overlooked that. Good combination of action and horror.",7.0,9 July 2018
Really scary!,I finished the movie on HBO OnDemand then I pressed back and accidentally hit the restart button. I had a moment of panic. So I will give it a 2 for the skipped heart beat.,2.0,16 May 2019

A Decent Prequel,"For me The Purge series has consistently gotten better to say the least. The First Purge has genuine moments of thrill and excitement and puts character development in the back seat which is okay with me. This is the 4th film in the series and if you're expecting anything more than a carnage filled thriller with bizarre social commentary, then the film isn't the problem, it's you.",6.0,11 July 2018
Embarrassingly BAD,"I was embarrassed sitting in the theatre. I eventually had enough and walked out! Worst movie of the year. The only positive thing is that, after I tuned it out, I had time to think about the TRASH Hollywood turns out. And I resolved to go to much less movies and be more discerning about the movies I go to. So I'm grateful I will stop seeing these random garbage movies and save some money.

Ok I'm ashamed I would see this immoral twisted movie. What is tragic is that so many people see this trash. What is wrong with us to not know better. We should not be seeing this stuff and maybe the will stop making them.",1.0,5 July 2018
A Beyond Lacklustre Prequel,"I'm not a big horror fan, but I always appreciate when a great horror flick comes along. When The Purge was released back in 2013, I was very underwhelmed by it, as the premise itself intrigued me enough to warrant a viewing. The biggest issue I had with that film is that it was a country-wide event that was self-contained in one house. When the second film came along I was inclined to give it a chance because it did what I hoped the first film was going to. Now, this franchise has gone n for far too long and we have arrived at a prequel in The First Purge. The idea of going back to the very first purge has potential, but this film lives up to nothing of the sort. Anything good to speak of this franchise has now been killed in my eyes. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and one of the worst films I've seen in 2018, period.

Taking place years before the events of the original film, an experimental purge is held on Staton Island in New York. Dealing with gangs, families, and people who just have the urge to murder, this film focusses on many different people, making it a jumbled mess of a movie. The plot of this film is no different than any of the previous installments, aside from not quite making a valid argument as to why these events even take place each year, which is what I felt this film's only job was in the first place. Failing to provide insight as to why this event continues on is just the icing on the cake of what makes this film so dreadfully bad though.

Although I'm not a huge fan of the franchise, each consecutive film was at least able to provide characters that had a backstory for you to follow and while this film attempts to, it comes off as lazy writing, stereotyping people and giving them nothing but clichéd backstories all across the board. If you literally go to watch these films based on the fact that people murder each other and you don't mind having zero depth to the characters involved, then this film may slightly please you, but at least in my opinion, your bar for entertainment might have to be pretty low for this one to impress you.

On top of these elements, this is a very easy film to nitpick. The First Purge is riddled with jump scares that come out of nowhere (which I can't stand), some of the blandest dialogue I've heard all year, and quite frankly some very lazy editing techniques. This film has a relatively low budget, just like its predecessors, but it's no excuse when the editing and visual effects would be noticeable in a movie that cost a studio ten bucks.

As I mentioned, this movie can be nitpicked until the end of time, but there is one particular scene that ruined any hope I had for this film. Surprisingly, this scene involves a character played by Marisa Tomei. I love her as an actress, but I was shocked to see her appear in this film. Her character is only present to spew expositional dialogue that will even seem dumb to young kids. There is a sequence in this film that is shown through a video feed to her character and after the audience witnesses that they're all wearing masks, she literally exclaims that they're wearing masks, so that the viewers will understand those are the people who are choosing to purge. This film has quite a few moments like this and it just had me shaking my head in disappointment.

The First Purge hardly has a single redeeming quality, aside from maybe a visual choice of giving glowing contact lenses to the people who choose to purge. That element was cool visually, but that had no effect on the overall movie. When your film fails to have your audience care about who lives and who dies, there's something seriously wrong. I truly felt that one of the most unlikeable characters was one that you're meant to be rooting for, which gave me a very uncomfortable viewing experience. In the end, this movie fails on more levels than its predecessors, so even if you're a slight fan of the franchise, I still don't know if this one warrants a recommendation. The First Purge is garbage entertainment.",2.0,4 July 2018
"Is this the end, or the beginning","Ok so there are many bad reviews for this film. Many are saying this is a rwcist movie blah blah. Truth is, yes the government or NFFA is portrayed in this movie to be targeting the black community as most of the cast are black and everyone who lives in the apartment towers of interest are definitely black. Umm, so what? Do we all have a problem with risky filmmaking? Is that not what some of the most successful and well known horror films are made of? I am an avid horror fan and upcoming director and honestly i think it was a great idea to hand the Purge series over to a black director and let him put out something mainstream for the black film community. It doesnt mean itll stay there. A 5th installment could prove there is still life here. After all, the way the 3rd Purge was headed was very political and racial. I myself think the movie was great. It had the most grit out of the series and the connection between characters was deep and felt, and when a cared for one dies or there is a heartfelt moment, it IS effective. The violence portrated is good, not great. Its not bloody. I have somewhat of a hard time seeing where the budget went on this film, as there was little on screen violence that was actually detailed. I personally loved the main character, Dwayne. He was a badass with a heart. Its hard foe,ke to say where this one stands in the series. A part of me wants to call,it the best. But a part of me wants to call it the worst.",7.0,3 October 2018
Absolutely terrible,"I couldn't even finish watching it. The acting is terrible, editing and overall flow of the movie was poorly put together.

Because such purge day is going every year occurred even a lot of men get killed, must have a sound reason and we find that reason here. Well plotted and believable story !

Horrible! The first was original and much better,,1.0,4 July 2018
A good action movie.,"For goodness sake, stop over analysing movies. yes it was OTT with race connotations, yes it had characters dressed as Nazi's and KKK, and all the bad guys in power seemed to be white. But you are watching a fantasy action movie that to me, did NOT take itself too seriously. The action is good, especially in the tower near the end. One fight on the stairs reminded me of John Wick, where the camera just sits there and films, rather than have 50 different shots of each punch. It could have done with explaining the lead characters' ability to fight and take out mercs, but who cares really. Just enjoy the film and stop comparing it to socioeconomic writings and moral judgements.",8.0,25 October 2018
Back To Where It All Started,"It was an idea that writer/director James DeMonaco had back in 2013: What if there were a 12-hour period during the night, throughout America, at the start of spring, where everybody's pent-up anger could be released in a spree of looting, vandalism, rape, and mass murder? And what if it were the thing that kept crime and unemployment at bay for the other 364½ days of the year? DeMonaco referred to such an event as THE PURGE, and it became one of the better horror films of 2013 in its original incarnation, where elements of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, STRAW DOGS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD were combined into one very nightmarish brew. It was thus followed in 2014 by THE PURGE: ANARCHY, and in 2016 with THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR.

And in 2018, though he had ceded the director's chair to Gerald McMurray, the director of the disturbing but excellent 2013 film FRUITVALE STATION, DeMonaco still had his hand in with the screenplay for a ""Purge"" prequel, THE FIRST PURGE.

In this (loosely) fourth film it what has become an increasingly blood-and-profanity-soaked series, we are taken back to how the ""Purge"" phenomena got started in the first place, in 2021, a year before the events that we saw in the original (which was set in Los Angeles). It is intended as an experiment by a psychologist (Marisa Tomei) to be conducted in isolation on Staten Island, though funded by the National Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), the third political party that has arisen to do what they say neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can or will do-which, basically, is allegedly to bring back the American Dream, or whatever that used to be. But as Tomei finds out to her horror, what was intended to be a release valve for people's anger is actually intended, according to the NFFA's chief spokesperson Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh), to expunge ""lower class"" citizens (pretty much people can tell who those people are and what they look like) from the American landscape. When the Purge doesn't seem to have the intended effect that Tomei wanted, Darragh sends in a bunch of outsiders in KKK-type hoods and the familiar ""Purge"" masks to do the job.

Apart from Tomei, and the Staten Island drug kingpin portrayed by Steve Harris, THE FIRST PURGE doesn't have any recognizable faces, let alone the FBI agent portrayed by Frank Grillo in the previous two ""Purge"" films (he decided to sit this one out without DeMonaco in the director's chair). We do have a number of sympathetic Black and Hispanic characters in the film. We also have plenty of surveillance sequences from within the NFFA headquarters and out on the streets that, as in the previous films of the series, hearken back to George Orwell's classic Dystopian novel ""1984"", as well as THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND and MINORITY REPORT. And, this being 2018 we're living in, the film is clearly and inevitably intended as a swipe at the White Nationalist movement fueled by the presidency of one Donald John Trump.

As a film, however, THE FIRST PURGE, like THE PURGE: ANARCHY and THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR, has fallen into a standard brew of over-the-top violence and profanity, gratuitous sex, and oftentimes overblown acting, partly due to McMurray's direction, but mostly due to DeMonaco having written the screenplay in a way to appeal to a typical 21st century summer horror and action film crowd. If the original 2013 film showed anything at all, it showed that films in the horror and/or action films didn't have to degenerate to that level.

I'm giving THE FIRST PURGE a '7' rating based on the original and sinister premise behind it, but it could have been so much more.",7.0,8 July 2018
Good series ruined by politics,"What I loved about the Purge series is how it focused on the darker side of humanity. No one was able to be viewed as a ""good guy"" because, given the right circumstances, we all harbor terrible passions that can be let out if allowed. In this movie, they show ""how it all started"" but in doing so, they couldnt help but pander to a certain group of people who want to make all white people evil and all black and poor people victims. Even the black gangsters who routinely kill and spread evil over the world end up being shown as ""true heroes"". Why does everything have to be ""this group is good, this group is bad""? There are good and bad in ALL groups and that is what made Purge so awesome. I doubt I will watch any more of these films. Trust Hollywood elite to ruin a good thing because they cant keep their opinions to themselves.",5.0,10 October 2018
An absolute disgrace,"I nearly missed half this film as I kept rolling my eyes at the sheer lameness of the scenes. Maybe I should have just walked out, missed the film and spared that hour of my life. Like, who gets away with writing garbage like this? And who casts these 'actors'? Just shocking. The comic relief woman -whose character I'm sure was inspired by the 'aint nobody got time for dat' woman - was so bad at her acting, the comic relief was cringey and not funny at all. The racial message here is so blatant I actually fear for this country. Why is anybody allowed to make heroes out of racists? Imagine we flipped the scenario...just imagine... Satan's balls what a terrible film.",1.0,6 October 2018
On par with the original Purge.,"The tension of The First Purge takes longer than expected to initially kick in, and is then undermined by unnecessary and completely out of context bouts of humour. The performances are wholly mediocre and the main antagonist veers towards laughable. The social commentary of the previous films is present here, but doesn't move in any unexpected directions. The only scene that I can recall as being outstanding is an excellently choreographed fight scene near the end of the film.",6.0,7 July 2018
The worst purge,"Seriously, you get bored from the begining of the movie, the whole thing is flat and slow, not worth the time even for free ticket.",1.0,4 July 2018
Another Solid Entry for the Purge Faithful,"Instead of repeating the same crazy and hysterical night, the writer and creator of the Purge franchise (James DeMonaco) went back and they created a prequel with the First Purge. This was probably to avoid stagnation with the franchise and I can get on board with that. When it comes to the writing in this entry, I thought they did a decent job of filling in some of the previous cracks in the mythology. They give the residents of Staten Island a reason to participate in the experiment and the rollout of the idea is done carefully (as much as it can be). I also appreciated that this movie provided a glimmer of hope in terms of human nature. Most people are at least initially reluctant to participate and that's one of the first admissions by the creative team that all of humanity isn't morally abhorrent. So, while I was impressed by some aspects of the writing, they do continue with the same hammy dialogue that all the other movies feature. I respect DeMonaco as a writer and director (even though he's only handling screenwriting duties in this one) but bringing in someone to be more understated with the dialogue would be appreciated going forward.

The First Purge features a couple of twists that I won't spoil but I thought they were well handled for the most part. Conversely, The Purge franchise isn't one you can rely on to create memorable characters. The closest we got to a returning hero was the Sargent/Leo Barnes played by Frank Grillo. The First Purge centres around Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and Isiah (Joivan Wade) and how effective their characters are is decidedly mixed. Isiah is almost the audience avatar, anyone who watches the Purge movies likes to think that they'd be out there running the show but as Isiah learns the hard way, its all well and good until you run into some seriously crazy people and you realize how out of your league you are. Nya is probably the most generic of the 3, she's the anti-purge activist and is responsible for delivering the message of the movie. I want to get into Dmitri more later, but while he has a clear motivation and you can understand his point of view, the method to his madness is flawed.

One of the returning issues from other Purge movies is that a lot of the acting borders if not falls into chewing the scenery. The most annoying part was Rotimi Paul as Skeletor. I don't want to completely blame him, part of it was his character but I couldn't stand him and when he makes a surprise appearance at the end, I was rolling my eyes so hard. I did enjoy Y'lan Noel as Dmitri, he made for a charismatic lead despite his character and his work in the action scenes closer to the end could have qualified him for a reboot of the Punisher. Lex Scott Davis conveyed a lot of compassion and righteous anger well as Nya and Joivan was capable as Isiah. I was disappointed Marisa Tomei didn't get more to do as Dr. Updale. Casting her as the scientist who came up with the Purge was inspired but she only acts steely and reserved until an improbable tangent undercut her character.

The politics surrounding the Purge franchise are never subtle and while I wish they could be woven into the plot with a lighter touch, that idea being shoved in your face continues in The First Purge. If this makes you angry or you disapprove, nothing I can say will change your mind. Maybe putting this franchise in different hands would help it be more organic. I do think that Dmitri is an interesting character, but I also agree with the criticism that he's a drug lord and the movie wants you to just forget that he's destroying his neighbourhood (the movie points it out but at the end, he's celebrated like a hero and it rings somewhat hollow). So, if you're turned off by the message this movie is championing, that's your choice and I won't convince you of anything different. But this franchise has had 3 movies already and if you're shocked that there's a heavy political slant to this, you obviously haven't seen the other 3. I find all the outrage directed at this entry to be puzzling, why is this a surprise to anyone? This was the rhetoric since 2013.

The Purge franchise continues to soldier on and while this is a middling entry, I still enjoyed it. The action scenes toward the end were filmed in an interesting way, Y'lan Noel gave a solid lead performance despite the contradictory nature of his character and I still love the potential of this premise. It was one of the big ideas to come out of horror and it's a license to do anything or go any direction and I think we need more of that. The biggest problem with this movie is that instead of dialing up the horror and the thrills (like my favourite Purge movie, The Purge: Anarchy), they doubled down on the politically charged momentum of The Purge: Election Year which wasn't the best aspect of that movie. This movie has a lot to say and isn't afraid to say it and I don't disagree with that message. I want this franchise keeps going but I hope it attracts some bigger name talent. If you got some high calibre actors and a punch up writer for the dialogue, I think they could create something special. If you're a Purge fan, I think you'll enjoy this, but I wouldn't expect this to win over many new converts.",7.0,12 July 2018

intriguing origin story,"The American economy has crashed. The political system is in turmoil. The two party system has fallen and the New Founding Fathers of America has been elected. Dr. May Updale is The Architect of the First Purge and Staten Island has been selected for the experiment. Locals are given $5000 each to participate. At first, most would rather throw big street parties or hide behind locked doors. Individual attacks soon becomes widespread as bigger powers aim to use the purge for their own purposes.

A prequel origin story is often unnecessary in established franchises. The purge could be one of those. It's an else-world that has logics of its own. It never made much sense to me but this movie is able to use today's world logic to make it more relevant. With today's understanding, the phrase 'this could happen' gets closer to reality. So the overall franchise premise is enhanced by this movie. That's its biggest contribution. It has the attempt even if it is unable to do it cleanly. The reality of the situation demands more realism from its violence. The lead's superhero antics do not fit. There are a few questionable aspects. The KKK hoods are too on the nose. Staten Island is probably not the right neighborhood. The overall world situation needs more clarity. Despite all the minor issues, the central premise is compelling and it's a good B-movie thriller anyways.",7.0,1 October 2018
The First Purge: The First Purge is the worst Purge,"I've said since day one that The Purge is an incredible concept which positively reeks of potential. I love the idea and there is so much that could done with it, but the moment the first film revealed itself as yet another home invasion movie my belief that Hollywood could do it justice diminished.

Now here we are with the 4th movie and a prequel no less, they've had 5yrs to think about the concept and what they could do with it. So why is this latest offering the worst?

You know what it reminds me of? Attack the Block (2011), that awful British sci-fi movie about aliens that attack a council estate. So we have the absolute scum of the Earth as our protagonists and I'm supposed to cheer them on? Absolutely not.

The First Purge does the same thing, our ""Heroes"" are drug dealers, weapons merchants etc who I simply cannot get behind. If a movie has no real protagonists it's DOA for me.

Full of the usual fantastic social commentary, incredible aspects of the Purge concept but once again a weak delivery. For the fourth time the concept feels wasted and instead we're subjected to another brainless action flick.

The more I think about the concept however the more I question whether it can be done justice. Surely there is someone out there who can do something with it?

So in conclusion, The First Purge is the worst Purge.

The tired and pointless purge,"Disked 'The Purge', apart from the reasonable two leads and a nice gritty look it was tired, poorly written, cheesy, tension and suspense free with annoying characters. Sort of liked 'The Purge: Anarchy', while finding it flawed in especially the writing Frank Grillo's presence livened things up a lot. Had mixed feelings on 'The Purge: Election Year', it had its moments (again Grillo and the committed cast) but the writing, uneven story and characters sunk it.

Saw 'The First Purge' as somebody trying to see as many 2018 films as possible and as somebody who had not given up on the franchise. Seeing 'The First Purge', it was wholly indicative that a series that was already starting to flag had completely worn thin. There are no new ideas, anything interesting and even for a prequel it felt completely unrelated to the other 'Purge' films, having none of the few good things present in 'The Purge'. Also saw absolutely no reason for the film to be made or existing. By far the worst of the series and one of the year's worst (have seen a lot so feel qualified to say that).

Absolutely nothing worked in 'The First Purge'. Although most of the acting was weak in 'The Purge', the two leads were reasonable. In 'The First Purge', all the acting is lousy, playing characters that are impossible to get behind in a film full of shallow and unrelatable characters that behave so stupidly and illogically, as well as being written in such a biased and not-for-the-easily-offended fashion. Not even the decent production values there is here, the film instead looks cheap and rushed-looking.

No tension or suspense at any point and nothing scary or thought-provoking, got nothing enlightening. The pace dragged badly, which undermined the suspense, likewise with the excessive predictability and clichés that were tired well before the film was made, even more tired than in 'The Purge'.

The scary aspect is cheap and never surprising, creative or scary, the violence being gratuitous, the situations so ridiculously dumb that it insults the audience and the villains are goofy and flat caricatures, nothing menacing about them. The direction is generally indifferent and the action far from exciting.

In summary, awful with nothing redeeming about it. 1/10 Bethany Cox",1.0,9 August 2018
The First Purge - Spoiler Free Review,"I guess before I start this review, I should probably mention that I was not up to date on 'The Purge' franchise while viewing this; I only saw the original in parts - didn't like it - and didn't bother with the two sequels, hell this prequel I didn't even know had come out yet and the only reason I ended up seeing it, was because I had two hours to burn between seeing 'The Nun' and 'The Meg'. So up until recently, I went to bed at night knowing a few things, I was born with two hands, mayonnaise is heavier than milk and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' will undoubtedly be the worst movie that I'll see in 2018...and now I have seen 'The First Purge' and sitting there felt like somebody was slowly dissecting my brain with a butter knife and charging me money to sit there and watch it. This movie makes 'Leprechaun Back to Tha Hood' look like 'Shawshank Redemption' and if you're wondering why I chose that particular reference, it's because 'The First Purge' is a black movie - I don't even feel racist saying that, because this screenplay very well could have been written by Julius Malema...going by the assumption that he's actually able to read; I'll explain why in a second. So as the title suggests, this movie plays off before the original, and starts off a few days before the first experimental 'Purge' is scheduled to take place. Staten Island is the location chosen for this experiment and the government is offering five thousand Dollars to every resident who chooses to stay the night, with bonuses promised to those who actually go out and purge...yay. Here's this movie's view on the world: all black people are poor and underprivileged, and are suppressed by white authorities who see them all as liabilities that should simply be disposed of. That's quite literally the world in this film, every single resident of Staten Island is black and underprivileged and every single government worker is white and evil. Now usually I'd say something about the characters or acting here, but what can I possibly say? There is no character to carry this film, the closest thing it has to a lead is drug dealer/saint (even though we see him execute rival gang members throughout the film), Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), possibly the most uneven character ever written; it's like there were two writers working on this script and they never spoke two words to each other before handing it in as completed. The only other two characters I should probably mention are Nya and her little brother, Isaiah; I guess these are the two characters we're supposed to care about, but neither have enough depth or development to pull that off. There are about a million side characters, who are basically indistinguishable, they all talk the same, they all sound the same, they all act the same...to such an extent that on several occasions, when a character is killed, and they actually take a good minute or two for the characters and audience to mourn the loss...I did not have a clue who the deceased characters were supposed to be. Wow, this movie is awful. Now, I have heard from several sources that the previous two entries in this franchise were actually quite decent, with special emphasis always put on the death scenes being quite imaginative, that's what you'd expect from a movie like this...in this case: don't, it's all just characters getting stabbed and shot, with zero intensity, because you don't care whether any of the characters live or die, anyway. There's a scene with Dmitri hunting down government soldiers that goes on way too long, with the screen flashing throughout the majority, people complained about 'The Blair Witch Project' making them feel sick, well this scene might just give you a seizure. I don't even know what else to say about this movie, I feel like I'm just ranting, but, in my defence, that's exactly what this movie was doing: it's a cash grab film in a popular franchise that brings nothing new to the table, offers very little info that we weren't already familiar with and just runs through the motions, obviously struggling to fill its 1 hour and 38 minute run time. Overall, avoid this movie like the plague, rather go bash your head against a wall for 2 hours, just, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie. As stupid as the concept of 'The Purge' is, I kinda hope that it does eventually happen so that people can punish everyone who worked on this film.",1.0,14 September 2018

The sister and brother Nya and Isaiah are a good team, always try to protect themselves, and be prepared for the Purge. Skeletor is a creepy drug addict, his behavior does gives me goosebumps, you can easily tell he's serious, and that he's ready for this to start. The movie has some good pacing and some creepy suspense. The action is intense as well. My only problem with this movie is that the acting is a little wooden, but overall a good movie.",8.0,18 October 2018
Middling prequel to The Purge that takes the story back to the beginning,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

The residents of a run down neighbourhood in Stratton Island, New York, are given financial incentives to participate in the first ever 'purge', a brutal social experiment in which murder will be made legal for twelve hours at night. While some view the five thousand dollar reward money as something worth fighting for, a lot of resistance is also put up, headed by Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), the local drug dealer who's spotted the potential for rival dealers to eliminate the competition he poses. As the night winds on, and the mayhem spirals out of control, he becomes an unlikely hero as he leads the battle for survival...

Only four films (very minor today for a horror franchise, even such a recent one) in, and it's still hard to believe the original Purge film came out five years ago now. In a time of cheap, derivative horror films, the originality and intelligence of it still stands out for me, and it's definitely the best one I've seen in that time. In my review of the most recent one before this, The Purge: Election Year, I said hopefully they would leave it at that (or words to that effect), and that another sequel would ruin it, but here new director Gerard McMurray (in the first film not directed by James De Monaro) takes us back to the beginning, before the first film with 'the first ever purge.'

As original and suspenseful as the first film was, the deeper meaning of it kind of went over my head, and it took the two (admittedly inferior) sequels for the subtle social commentary and socio-economic observation to sink in. In this film, it's an all out assault, portraying how the rich and powerful exploit the poor and ignorant, and how they want to enforce population control in order to bring down their numbers and not be such a burden. Centring on a predominantly black neighbourhood, living in poverty and hopelessness, there is a touch of the Black Lives Matter movement about it, but to be honest it never feels overly heavy handed or preachy.

In terms of being a horror film, it pretty much follows the script of the original trilogy, with the 'Purge commencement' broadcast and the accompanying siren (bruuuuuuuuur bruuuuuuuuuuuuuur bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuur) as unnerving as ever, a genuine sense of being in a desperate battle for survival and one or two really effective jump scenes that will bring a shock to your system. It doesn't reach the heights of the original, but it's certainly no worse than the last two, and McMurray has proved a worthy successor to De Monaro. ***",7.0,10 July 2018

Bad all the way.,This is by far the worst Purge movie. Just bad bad bad all the way. Total waste of time to watch. I rather watch Bambi insted of this crap.,1.0,6 September 2019
I really liked this one!,"It's a good combination of suspense and action, taking place on Staten Island New York, the film is about the very first experiment that would end up being known as the purge. Though Staten Island is far more culturally diverse, the movie concentrates on the idea about the Purge being a good excuse to get rid of the lower social class.

I felt that the other movies were more equal on the concepts of who gets purged, and who does the purging. Then again, this movie more so falls in line with the original film rather than it's two sequels, but keeps the action of the two sequels instead of the horror thriller that was the original purge.

I also like that while all the movies are set in the future, this one is the only one using futuristic technology, or rather using technology totally available right now, and it makes it look more futuristic than the others.

Anyway, the movie starts out slow explaining the story, but picks up really quickly. It's so much fun to watch, especially the guy playing King D, a drug dealer who cares more about his community than the so called government and becomes a clone of Wesley Snipes when he has to save his ex-lady from Purgers. It seems a little over the top than what Frank Grillo was doing in the last two sequels, but it does make for an awesome movie to see.

It feels okay to Purge...,"This is unabashed and unadulterated exploitation, but it is exploitation for 2018. One day people will look at this the same way we look at Wild in the Streets from 1968 or The Running Man. It beats you over the head with a shovel with its message and exposition (oh the script, my god it hurts).

But the action is good and bone crunching, the character Skeletor (yes, that's his name) deserves his own fuller movie, and there were some scattered ideas I found compelling and fascinating, especially how the NFFA goes about really kicking the Purge into highest gear as a means of depleting the lowest tax income bracket. It's full of types both white (the one dimensional douche pushing the agenda in the control room) and black (the one woman who is both sassy and funny). But most of the actors are committed to this material, and the blunt force is felt.

Again, this isnt exactly a *good* movie - this is one where a woman literally gets her vagina grabbed by a creep in a mask, because again it's a movie with the red MAGA hat as the poster - but I certainly was never bored, and it got my brain going.",6.0,6 July 2018

The Most Atmospheric Purge Film. Like New Jack City & A Nightmare On Elm Street Mixed-up.,"The first purge was excellent!!! (Anarchy is the best of the franchise though)

An Action packed ride through the first ever purge night & it was exciting & sometimes scary & so entertaining & with an even more gritty & real vibe to this entry. The first Purge is the most politically important film of the franchise that is full of messages & important moments. This futuristic sci-fi thriller is moulded in the old school 1970's way as a piece of science fiction wrapped in political statements about America of its time. Also the film is a heavy Blaxploitation piece with its black people's fears fully on display of a corrupted government that targets poor people of colour & basically wants to ""clean up"" America of the poor neighbourhoods & those that they simply don't like. This Purge film is an explosive political grenade of a movie that puts up on screen all the wrong doings that black folk go through within America. But this flick doesn't just attack America & its government & it's white heat, oh no as it also shows that often Black folk are to blame themselves at times like dealing drugs to their own people in their own neighbourhoods!!! That's why this film is so damn good because it shows both sides of this story & includes Anti-heroes just like 70's Blaxploitation films.

This Purge is the most Atmospheric of the franchise, this one oozes urban Hood Horror atmosphere & the streets are more dangerous & scary then ever & this has some of the most intense action scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time, this could sit happily next to ""Dredd"" & ""The Raid"" for outstanding action scenes & real intense gritty action.

This Purge is the most relevant & the most racially & politically charged, IT'S todays ""Trump"" infested America gone crazy like a nightmare what if scenario, this messed up corrupted America is seen through the eyes of the colourd people & just like in real life they are pushed into a corner & must fight to survive!!!

This covered pretty much everything that is against ""Black people"" & what they face in America still today!!!

I got the homage right away when we first see D'mitri he's dressed & looks just like Wesley snipes in New Jack City (1991) & there's alot of hints to A nightmare on elm street, like the director merged the two films together & created a masterpiece.

This had a real 90's feel about it but also a coating of 70's Blaxploitation & Exploitation cinema.

The music was really good as it went from urban hip hop to creepy Carpenter style & worked really well as did the excellent eerie cinematography of the scary night it felt scary & suspenseful & the setting was really good in the big tower block in the low income area of staten island.

At times this movie felt like a cool gang Thriller & then moved into Carpenter Horror territory & then changed into Brutal ""Die Hard"" style action but all worked fine & was very exciting.

The main guy was AWESOME Y'lan Noel as D'mitri the gang king pin of the area & he become the ""Die Hard Style"" action Hero of the movie & he was great very much reminded me of a young Wesley Snipes like he was in New Jack City but with a hint of Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson so YEAH a great lead & i think he could be a big new action star in the making!!! Get this guy in a Predator movie please!!!

The music is Fantastic in this movie too & there's fantastic cinematography very John Carpenter style reminded me sometimes of The Fog & Escape from New York with its gloomy look & dim street lights & Smoke on almost every street like the fog creeping in & it's very effective to give it that very creepy atmosphere like a proper Horror movie. There real movie craft to the design of this one & is definitely the scariest of the franchise.

Also i have to say that the Skeletor drug fiend psycho villain character was scary as hell & actually one of the scariest movie villains I've ever seen & believe me I've seen alot of movies being a movie buff!!!

Another great performance was from the young actor Joivan Wade he was excellent!!!

All characters are good in this very slick & hip Urban Action Thriller & yes was a fantastic entry into an excellent franchise & my personal favourite.

This is grimy gritty brutal action packed entertainment that mixes Grimy & Gritty Gothic Hood Horror with old school brutal Action & sci-fi Thriller & it's perfect movie making that's Fresh & exciting with racial messages & politics tossed around all over & completely Entertaining but i don't care about all the political stuff i was just purely entertained by a sci-fi Horror survival Thriller with a top notch cast & excellent visuals.

Deserves a place next to excellent ""Anarchy"" as the two best so far in the franchise.

A great old school ""Blaxploitation"" vibe & a visually stunning Sci-fi Action Thriller with a real grim relevant vibe to todays violent hellish America!!!",7.0,11 November 2018

MAGA,"First off, this movie has everything that a 'prequel' should have. If you have watched any of the three other Purge movies, then you are very much aware of its concepts. This movie further explains the origins of the Purge and how and why this historic night was established. The First Purge delivers frightful scenes, relatable characters, some laughable moments, and most importantly outstanding performances by its actors. The First Purge is not meant to be a typical Horror ghost or alien movie, rather it stands in its own category.

Just a Hollywood Dumpster Fire,"The First Purge does nothing except lead you down a two hour road of racial exploitation and violence that's stripped of any real film merit, leaving you with nothing but a screen filled with darkness and anger.

This is the story of the first purge- a social experiment commissioned by the New Founding Fathers of America. (You don't have to be Einstein to figure out who they represent). Staten Island is chosen as the site of a one night free-for-all where the laws are repealed, and people are encouraged to release their anger in a night of violent rage.

The filmmakers either couldn't or wouldn't summon any of the vibe present in better movies of this type. See: Escape From New York, Assault on Precinct 13, the Warriors, etc. John Carpenter is nowhere to be found in this thing. Even racial exploitation has been done better. Take a look at Three the Hard Way from 1974.

Since this movie can't make the jump into that world of better, more stylistic and well-conceived movies, it becomes impossible to sell this and whatever message it's trying to make. The absurdity of the premise is revealed, and all you're left with is an ugly, angry movie.

Hard pass on this one.",1.0,2 January 2024
Creepy and thrilling but it does start slow and work its way up to make this worth watching.,"The First Purge (3.5 out of 5 stars).

The First Purge is a prequel and the fourth installment in its dystopian action horror series of films. The film is entertaining and decent. The first movie was more of a horror home invasion movie. The two sequels following that was an action film were people are given 12 hours to do whatever they want without any consequences. The First Purge literally is the start of its dystopian future. Were the New Founding Fathers of America wanted to test a new experiment. Were people can release all there anger and violence in a 12 hour period. They want to do this experiment on Staten Island. And people who participate are given money. They are given camera contact lenses so the NFFA can track and record there actions. And to see if this experiment is a success.

The plot follows Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and her younger brother Isaiah (Joivan Wade) who are living in a low class complex. Isaiah is involved in drug dealing behind his sister's back. While the kingpin drug dealer Dmitri (Y'Lan Noel) is trying to help. But when the purge experiment happens in their neighborhood. Nya holds up in a refuge shelter at a church while her brother wants to find a psychopath that humiliated him. Dmitri tries to stay low and demands his crew to do the same. That they should not acknowledge the idea of killing. When Nya and Isaiah are trying to survive the night. Dmitri and his crew try to help those that are defenseless.

The film being a prequel and limiting the concept of Purge on Staten Island as an experiment does start out pretty slow. We are introduced with the characters. Dmitri being the anti-hero, a drug dealer that wants to help people that is defenseless. Especially, during the climax, when he goes in Rambo mode with killing an army of mercenaries in an apartment complex. It does have a slow start. When the siren warning begins, people are all just walking around armed trying to protect their properties. Some decide to set up booby traps for their enjoyment. Some are creeps that try to prey on girls. Some throw a block party. Then, there is a psychopath walking among the people and killing them for fun. And a mercenary group that is killing for sport.

The film does have its jump thrills with people popping out of nowhere. And the contact lenses that is used as a camera does add a lighting effect to the eyes which made the people even creepy. Especially, when people are walking down an alley and seeing creepy stares through windows. The film does have some thrills and suspense. The action does pick up in the last half hour of the movie. When Dmitri tries to save Nya and her brother from a group of mercenaries.

Overall, The First Purge is a pretty fair film. If you like senseless violence, than this is the movie for you. It does have a slow start and burn with the concept. But it does pick up in a loud, shoot them up action climax. The story this time is getting burnt out and dull.",7.0,6 July 2018
"Fan of the others, but not this one.","It had potential, but was not suspenseful or interesting. Many of the scenes were predictable. I think I'm pretty middle. I saw it with my 18 year college daughter, who leans left. We both are fans of the others, with the first best, and the 3rd being really good. This one was not. She agreed. There was way too much white-bashing and obvious political commentary on today's society. We're both pretty sure we heard the main character say ""let's go get these white heads."" All that aside, too predictable and pandering.",4.0,5 July 2018
Fun action and thriller! I gave it 8,"If cutting the racial topic and character stereotypes based on complaints here, I find it very enjoyable. The main character "" D "" actually did awesome in action and the plot still makes sense for his character development. He's like anti hero that turned to protect community. Anyways , the craziness of the people , the sound effect and everything are quite effective. It got me screamed with my sister. I gave it 8 for the audience effect.",8.0,29 August 2018
"Another fun Purge movie, told from an interesting viewpoint - 68% (Favorable)","I enjoyed the original Purge movie, the second one even more so, but I did not like Election Year at all. This movie is a return to form for the franchise - I did enjoy it quite a bit though not as much as the first two. This one has a new director and it definitely shows as this movie has a very different tone to it.

I really liked Y'lan Noel in this movie, he is a total badass and I definitely want to see more of him. In fact, I'd say the acting overall is improved in this installment - I liked much of the supporting cast, Lex Scott Davis and Marisa Tomei in particular. I also dug the soundtrack, even though it felt like someone going through their Spotify playlist with a different song playing in back-to-back scenes. The action in this movie is also very thrilling and as the movie progressed I was definitely engaged and having a good time.

However, I noticed there was a bit too much violence in this movie compared to the others. Usually I don't mind that sort of thing but at one point it felt like someone was getting stabbed every other scene. There's also a notable difference in the delivery of it's social commentary and political message compared to the the other movies. This one is a bit heavy handed and definitely hits you over the head with it. Also, the main character, while fun to watch as an action star, isn't necessarily a person you want to root for in this movie.

Overall, The First Purge is another interesting and fun action thriller with a slightly different approach that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.",7.0,8 July 2018

Pretty disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this film. I really like the concept of the purge idea and believe it to have a lot of scope as an idea. I have seen all the others and feel that this is the worst of the series. There is almost no character development, there appears to be a very strong racial agenda, too, in that blacks appear to be virtually unanimously against whites. Most importantly there is very little explanation as to why the purge came about. I would give this film 2 stars simply due to the action scenes, which are moderately entertaining at times. Definitely an anticlimax to The Purge Election Year that I feel is the strongest, closely followed by The Purge Anarchy.",2.0,9 July 2018

BEST PURGE,,10.0,4 July 2018
Here Comes The Purge!...,"To be human is to be a lot of things, but in this day and age, anger, inpatient, greed, and many times politically inclined. Hence we get the Purge, a way to shed off all the negative energies in one night, by legalizing all crimes including murder. Years ago, we plunged into the series in a horror-like approach, that soon evolved into a much more political, drama thriller. Now, the prequel arrives to try and shed that last bit of light to the creation of the Purge, all while giving us more kills to bathe in. Hi I'm Robbie K and I'm here to share my thoughts on the latest movie to plunge into theaters. Let's see what the fourth installment has in store as I review:

Movie: The First Purge: (2018)

Director: Gerard McMurray Writer: James DeMonaco Stars: Y'lan Noel, Lex Scott Davis, Joivan Wade

LIKES:

Gripping Characters: The Purge has taken many leads to explain the journey of the ""blessed"" event and drop many characters into the throngs of death. This installment, the characters are actually gripping, realistic groups who have personalities and personas that anchor them to the tale. While there are flaws and strengths to exploit, the movie does a nice job developing the crew through the chaos, yet maintaining their core components as they try to survive the chaos unleashed. Even better, the characters that are extreme (much like in the third installment with the candy girl) are limited, helping reel it back to the suspense it wants. Even Marisa Tomei's character has a bit of twist on it, veering away from the one-dimensional route and adding a little more quality to the mix.

The Pace: The movie wins points for being able to accomplish so much chaos and carnage, while completing its story in about 90 minutes. This First Purge was very intense, and that led to a more exhilarating pace to entertain and leave you on edge. When the action gets started, and the morally justified bullets fly, the movie's speed only picks up and caps the film off with a nice action plot similar to components of Purge Anarchy (my favorite of the trilogy).

The Story Development: This prequel did little to add much in the terms of the overall story than what we already know, but it doesn't mean it's a weak story. On this first night, there are plenty of lives affected and many deeper than half the characters we were introduced to in the first films. Most of these characters tales come full circle in this tale, offering some satisfactory stories to talk about when the credits roll. A nice balance between all the characters was appreciated, as it kept most of the characters in the play relevant.

The Setting: It is realistic, it is creepy, and perhaps the most important, very relevant given the political state of affairs. The First Purge establishes the motif well, and turns a simple town, into a coliseum of destruction, which unfortunately could be any city. It's this setting that makes the series feel realistic, playing on a lot of factors that dominate the human psyche today. Needless to say, there is a warning to keep those impressionable minds away just in case.

The Action: My friend and I both agreed that the selling point (past the characters) is the action of this film. While there is a horror element to the film, the First Purge is more of an action thriller than anything else. As the drama unfolds, the truth starts to reveal itself, and the characters get fueled up, the bullets begin to fly. The result are a number of sequences that feel part robo cop, meeting Die Hard, Gangster Squad, and a little Equalizer all put together. It is an exciting climactic finish that starts to bring everyone's emotions to full boil. It felt very much at place, and I was stoked to see it tie the whole thing up in a... messy bow.

DISLIKES:

The Gorey Violence: Psycho thrillers will not be bothered by this, but The First Purge is no stranger to graphic kills. Gore, sounds of viscera being pierced, and agonizing moans of death are certainly what you have to worry about in this film. At times, it was acceptable, but at points it was a little unnecessary to go into the detail they did. Sorry guys, but that's not the selling point for me.

Dropping the Story Components: The main elements are there for the most part, but there are plenty of other components that got dropped or sloppily finished. Certain characters, a few antagonists, and some creepy relationships that held such potential were left to dwindle in the dust. Some of them they tried to go back to, but for me the execution of these attempts came off as if they had forgotten it up until the last minute. I applaud for the attempt, but these ridiculous characters had small goals to accomplish and could have used a better send off in my opinion.

The Weird Cinema Effects: I know, the Purge series has always been about glorifying the insanity of the people partaking in the festivities. This prequel is no different, but they managed to make a slight alteration that tried to mix soundtrack songs into the slow crawl of their faces. These moments didn't quite integrate into the movie well, and even worse, they kind of overused it for me and therefore not necessarily the most relevant to the mix. A minor flaw for me, but still worth mentioning.

The Stretches of Imagination: The movie I ridiculous, we all know that, but there are times where their stretching was a little too much. Many of the characters had insane stamina, incredible accuracy, or insane luck that was envious to video game players alike in regards to a character. Yet, when the moment came where it was needed, somehow that god like ability faded away, leaving them vulnerable at the wrong parts. Yes, rounds out the character, but the timing and inconsistency was a little too staged for me.

Political Heat: The movie is going to get a lot of things buzzing, for there are plenty of political topics that are fired up in this movie. Racism, poverty, government hesitation, and savagery are just some of the things that are introduced into this movie. It will divide and conquer the audience into two extremes, potentially leading to heated viewings and most likely mimicry in the near future. If you're not looking for hardcore analyses of these topics, stay away from this one.

THE VERDICT:

Overall, the First Purge adds little to the story overall, but it at least brings the characters to bat and hit home runs with. It's still creepy, it brings up good topics for discussion, and has an exciting climax to wrap things up, leading to one of the better installments into the mix. However, it is still a series that is far from my perfect, lost to extreme stretches of the imagination, predictable plots of incomplete stories, and an obsession for the gore are the selling points that aren't for me. Don't go if you are easily sickened by gore or political heat, because this movie is going to hit on all these topics. Yet, if you are a fan of this series, or looking for a decent action/thriller, you want to check this out on the theater. However, I believe there will be a better movie coming in further down the line.

My scores are:

RIP purge,"I've enjoyed the first three purge films as well as the Amazon series and the way they have all looked into the dark side of human nature etc, however this film totally ruins them all. It's nothing more than race baiting rubbish that is so blatant it's almost laughable. Poor plot, script and acting, Not to mention the slow mo shots as the Drug dealers head out to save the day...

Better Than Expected,"I had no desire to see this movie. I only went to chaperone my 16 year old kid. Surprisingly I was more entertained than I thought I'd be. It has a single, direct story line that can be followed and understood. The acting is decent. The characters are stereotypical, but accurate. It's a little incredulous in some parts, but I found myself rooting for the characters by the end of the movie. It's gory, but not overly so. It has some funny moments and some suspenseful moments.

Liberal dreck that panders to racial tensions and racist depictions.,"Whereas the previous Purge sequels portrayed working-class protagonists, white and non-white, that audiences can relate to who try to survive the night of the annual Purge, this prequel panders to stereotypes and racial hatred.

Gang members and drug dealers are not the saviors of the black and Hispanic communities, but the elements that have us living in fear. Yet this movie goes out of it's way to depict them in heroic fashion, because the people who write this stuff are either gravely misinformed or are purposely trying to mislead audiences about the living conditions in the ghetto.

I don't know what happened with the production of 'The First Purge', but it is a tremendous drop in quality from the previous films in the franchise. The performances are unconvincing, and this film fails to set out what it was meant to do, which is to depict the social conditions that lead to the establishment of the New Founding Fathers and their creation of the Purge.",,24 July 2018

I enjoyed,"First I would like to say that I don't expect the purge movies to be Oscar worthy movies. I'm looking for a little action and thrill. That being said, I think this movies was okay. The people that are complaining about race, are mostly white people. The fact of the matter is Racism is real, and there is a divide. The undertone of all the purges is that the minority are exploited and targeted the most, and with every new purge it becomes more obvious. The purge movies may be a little stereotypical in terms of that racism, but it's no different than black characters in majority white movies being portrayed as stereotypical blacks, so stop complaining. In fact it is different because it doesn't happen often.

I enjoyed this movie, I was tuned in. The fighting was definitely the best in all of the purges. It was more skilled, more precise. The story was different than I expected, but overall not bad. I would watch again, and I wish I supported it in the movie theater.",7.0,24 November 2018

No Connection with the Characters or Story,"Each the characters, the story, and the now-average action falls short when it comes to the sympathy we possess for the tension. The story of The First Purge is obvious and predictable, but the characters and savagery fails to save how terribly boring, dumb and foreseeable the film is.

The First Purge's plot sounds thoroughly interesting and you'll most likely engage into the tale, all before feeling disappointment for the lack of interest you feel. The characters are unlikeable and clearly make dumb choices from beginning to end. Although it honestly gets mildly cheesy, the fourth Purge instalment would also have to be the most violent film of the series so far, despite the action being the most enjoyable ingredient in the film.

But it's only the violent action that's enjoyable. The rest of The First Purge is predictably boring and you'll very likely miss the ability to connect with the characters and story. After this unnecessary continuation, another Purge film is not needed, or even wanted.

Smart idea poor execution,"So I finally watched the new Purge movie at the theater. I've been a fan of the series since the first. No, they are not the best horror movies, but I always enjoyed the premise and they are mildly entertaining.

The new film acts as a prequel to the series. Here we get to see the the start of a state sponsored social experiment that would morph into the Purge. From its origins we are introduced to the best aspects of this film. It plays as a direct political satire on far right ideology.

This is easily the most directly political movie in the franchise. It directly takes shots at political manipulation, racial inequality, collusion, and gun violence.

The movie has a number of smart concepts it wants to address, but that does not make a smart movie. In the end the film plays far more like an exploitation film against those grievances then a horror film.

There are absolutely zero elements of horror or suspense in the movie. Unlike the previous films there's not even any cool gore to keep you entertained to substitute for the lack of a coherent story.

There is a surprising amount of action in the movie, but most of it was ridiculously unrealistic. For some reason all of the protagonist had super ninja fighting skills that really felt out of place. It was an odd choice that further made this movie more of a B movie action exploitation film.

On top of that the movie really didn't have characters as much as they were caricatures. The good guys were gangsters with a heart of gold against the evil government sponsored foreign death squads. Not the most compelling writing.

In the end this movie had a message and concept that could have made a good movie. Unfortunately it was weighted down by poor writing, cheesy action, and zero horror elements. It still was a B fun movie and was better than the last two films the series, but no where close to the original. A 5.75 out of 10.",6.0,1 October 2018

One Of The Stronger Films In The Series,"This franchise has an inbuilt high-concept which makes it potential box-office gold: the ticking clock format, the opportunity for creative and widespread destruction/action set-pieces and (in the case of the first film) a very limited geographical setting for the action to play out. This instalment wisely returns to that last aspect by taking us back to the first 'experiment' purge taking place on Staten Island. It's largely successful, and one of the more effective entries in the series - not without faults, it remains taut and exciting and offering the most direct social-political commentary of any of the movies so far. This series started years before the current political drift to far-right nationalism, but in setting up a concept that works on the division between rich and poor and the cold-blooded machinations of the powerful on the powerless, this series has more to say than it's sometimes given credit for. It's precisely the sort of film that well-meaning types furrow their brows at and shake their hands about, saying 'Look what we've become ... how evil pop culture is'; when in reality missing that it's really saying 'Look where we may be headed'. It's easy to argue hypocrisy about such films, and of course, there is a degree of having your cake and eating it going on; but the reality is that those who watch violent films and play violent games are rarely the people who commit real-world violent acts.

Pretty heavy on the allegory.,"No doubt The First Purge, prequel to The Purge, takes allegory to its limits whereby it just misses being a straight commentary on the ills of a modern racist and classist society. I am the first to enjoy the metaphorical parallels of any horror film, but this one is bent on pushing home without subtlety the evils of white, totalitarian governments.

For 12 hours, the US is a punishment-free land, a plan seemingly devised by psychologists to release anger in the populace and to thin out the ranks of the underclass. Crime never seemed so undesirable as there is no punishment to give it an edge or satisfaction in pulling it off and eluding justice. Yet, somehow, the creeps finally emerge to blow away troublesome voters and tiresome do gooders.

However, it is a chance for gangs to eliminate each other and the authorities to manipulate the proceedings to give a favorable outcome to obvious racist and class discrimination. The major set is in a project on Staten Island, peopled by mostly blacks and some Latinos. The violence and bad stuff is aimed at them, and the resistance is a tribute to their abilities to bond and fight the establishment.

If you mated A Clockwork Orange with any mediocre dystopian production, beyond the few layers of political meaning, The First Purge is a cautionary tale about the need for brotherhood and the dangers of an authoritarian regime spreading propaganda about working for the good of the people. Seems to me I've heard that song before.",,9 July 2018
Good addition to the series,"Interesting how when black people are the protagonist in movies and white people are the antagonists, people get their panties in a bunch.",7.0,25 February 2019
Weak Politics & Powerful Violence,"'The First Purge,' not to be confused with the original 'Purge' film, despite the title issue that will inevitably cause misunderstandings in future conversations about the franchise, isn't much different from the other films in the series.

Sure, it dabbles in politics, making an attempt, but it never successfully articulates a message with any thoughtfulness or depth. Any political statement made is merely surface-level and clearly not rooted in anything resembling research or understanding. Other than that, the focus is on violence, which is abundant albeit cheaply made. It feels video game-like at times.

The events of the story open with news coverage of a speech from the president elect, who comes from a new political party that bears a likeness to the Alt Right and calls itself The New Founding Fathers of America. The party gained momentum after promising to rebuild the country after an economic collapse. Now the new president has sanctioned an experiment in Long Island that will make all crime legal, including murder, for 12 hours. They call it The Purge.

Okay, so now we know how it all started. Sort of. The film would benefit from added exposition on The Purge experiment. I'd like to see more about the scientific backing and the legal process that led to the experiment's approval, but that's not what most viewers paid to see, so I understand.

At least the movie made a meager effort to depict the events that preceded the first Purge, even if none of it was very well developed. Thankfully the politics do not overwhelm the movie. The filmmakers seemingly decided to get all that stuff out of the way early, then mention it only a few brief times later amidst the carnage and purging. There's also twist that everyone will see coming a mile away, but that's easy to look past.

All considered, the movie doesn't quite beat you over the head with its politics-it's more like a moderate slap to the face. I suppose I applaud the writers for making a socially conscious effort, I just wish they had made a better one.

On the bright side, the acting is solid, especially the two leads. They're the most redeemable part of the movie. Y'lan Noel, the leading man, has the makings of a possible star. Hopefully his terrific performance is not forgotten along with an otherwise forgettable movie.",4.0,12 July 2018
Why the hate peeps?,"6.7/8 ...... It seems to me that many people look for a reason to bash a movie based on race, religion, politics, etc. If you can watch this with the understanding that it's just a movie without an agenda, I think you'll enjoy it. The casting was great and the three main characters (which I've never seen before) did a phenomenal job in their roles. I look forward to seeing each of them as their careers go forward. And I cannot forget to give credit to the evil Skeletor character. He gave me the creeps within the first 10 seconds he appeared. Well done!!!!

Thank you for reading my review. I am a MovieFreak! rUaMovieFreak2",7.0,20 November 2020
I had to watch,"Before you criticize me for watching The First Purge just know that I had to. I've watched every Purge movie so I couldn't just stop. I'm too heavily invested by this point. Every Purge movie has been equally lousy too but I always remain hopeful. I'm so enchanted by the premise that I keep believing that one of these movies will turn out great.

For those of you that may be unfamiliar with the premise: the purge is a single 12 hour period observed in the U.S. each year in which all crimes are legal up to and including murder. As was mentioned in The Purge (2013); due to Purge Day overall crime is down, as well as poverty and unemployment. Economically, the U.S. is thriving because of this celebrated holiday. The Purge featuring Ethan Hawke focused on one family and their quaint neighborhood. The Purge: Anarchy widened the scope and followed a band of people throughout a city. The Purge: Election Year followed the politicians and those dedicated to ending The Purge as a holiday. Which brings us to The First Purge.

The First Purge is just that: the very first Purge. We get to see how the Purge was introduced and it just so happened to be introduced in Staten Island, New York. There was a financial incentive for the participants to help kick it off. There was no secret as to why it began in a depressed, poverty stricken place like Staten Island since financial incentives would appeal a lot more to those in most need.

The First Purge is probably the worst of the four installments. Instead of using subtleties and cleverness to state their message they assumed the audience was dumb and spelled out what was happening and why it was bad. The heroine in the movie is a fearless do-gooder and the antagonist(s) were mostly racist, capitalist white men. Not that I disagree with that, but I do disagree with the absence of tact, discretion and overall intelligence. They could've tried to make the bad guys less obviously bad guys.

The Purge, however despicable, remains a concept that is very intriguing. Too bad it's been botched so many times. If they care to make another attempt (which I hope they don't) they really should take the time to make a more intelligent script, less annoying characters and less Gestapo-like plots.",5.0,6 July 2018
A bad horror but an enjoyable action movie,"As a horror film, The First Purge fails miserably as it relies entirely on jump scares, none of which are genuinely scary or effective.

Overall, it's enjoyable but given the concept and premise it should have been much better.",6.0,20 December 2018

Here the action is better than the horror n it has a character known as skeletor who is downright insane n creepy.,"As a fan of the franchise I enjoyed this film.

The movie has sufficient action but somehow the tension is missing.

A horror thriller without good music is empty.

Tension filled music is lacking in this installment.

Nevertheless, a good one time watch for fans of the franchise.

EDITED my review on (19/07/2021) after revisiting it with my family on a dvd which i own as i am on a Purge movie marathon.

This is the fourth installment in the Purge franchise and a prequel showing how the United States came to the point of accepting the Purge Night. It shows how it originated as an experiment confined to Staten Island with the promise that those who stay on the island for its duration will be paid a large sum of money.

This time i found it to be far fetched. A local goon taking on lottuva mercenaries and that too alone is a big meh.

Also the character skeletor disappears for a longer duration n suddenly pops out of nowhere but that too for a tiny moment.",8.0,19 September 2018

I had to walk out of the movie theater ; most mexicans do not get the cultural references displayed here or under tones but it is just really bad time to take out this movie in this toxic environment.

The First Purge will hopefully be the last.,"The infamous low budget political horror franchise finally gets a prequel, and really was the wisest instalment to make. Our eternal question of ""how did the Purge start?"" is answered in an all too familiar formula that is overstuffed with subtextual layers. The NFFA have won the vote and are now conducting a sociological experiment that allows communities to vent aggression, in a bid to cull the population of America. DeMonaco withdrew from the directing chair and focused on writing a screenplay that would further explain the political and economical agendas of the Purge. Marginalised communities raging against oppression, an experiment that enables lower class civilians to reduce their own population by murdering themselves whilst the oppressors gain monetary benefits and make America ""a nation reborn"". The Purge has always been a hot topic, particularly in today's political climate, and the concept remains prevalent in this fourth chapter. The gritty violence and dystopian abstraction does make for some general entertainment, particularly one action scene on a stairwell, and will raise questions involving morality. DeMonaco involves you in this night of carnage, he allows you to cast your own opinion. Consequently, this resulted in his script to be overindulged in various subtextual components that no longer remain implicit. Discussions regarding overpopulation, oppression, crime and politics felt unnecessarily basic, as if he was holding our hand through these ""difficult"" topics. Unable to balance specific elements, he then also tries to tackle the psychological analysis behind the experiment, using an underused and unrecognisable Tomei as the creator of the experiment, yet fails to garner any real interest. It's all too basic and all too familiar. Nothing new is implemented to differentiate this entry from the rest. More uninteresting and underdeveloped characters from a similar community that the other films depict must survive the night where everyone instantly showcases lunacy. Yawn! A prequel brimming with rudimentary jump scares and a lack of conceptual progression.",5.0,6 July 2018
Lost a lot of it's shock value this time around.,"'THE FIRST PURGE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

The forth film in the popular horror flick series, and a prequel to the others, about the very first annual 'Purge' (a 12-hour yearly period where all violent crime is legal, including murder). The slasher flick was written by series creator James DeMonaco once again, who this time handed directing duties over to Gerard McMurray. It stars Y'Lan Noel, Marisa Tomei, Lex Scott Davis, Mugga, Joivan Wade, Luna Lauren Velez and Kristen Solis. The gory sequel has received mixed reviews from critics so far (just like the others), but it's also a very profitable hit at the Box Office as well (just like the others too). I found it to be the least well made, and effective of the series, but it's still definitely worth watching (if you're a horror movie fan).

The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), lead by Dr. May Updale (Tomei), first come up with the sociological experiment known as 'The Purge', in order to reduce the crime rate and restore the economy. It's tested solely in an isolated poor community (of mostly minorities), and people are offered money to participate. The test at first doesn't go as planned, and the NFFA takes matters into their own hands (in order to force it's success). The experiment of course then becomes adapted nationwide, leading to the events of the first three films.

The movie is violent and disturbing, just like the others, but it's definitely lost a lot of it's shock value this time around. It also just doesn't seem nearly as fresh and original anymore, or as thought-provoking. I like that it stars mostly minorities though (that's always a good thing), and Tomei makes a nice domineering villain (for a change). I think the film will be a lot more impressive, and entertaining, to those who haven't seen the other three films at least.",7.0,13 July 2018
I honestly feel embarrassed for everyone involved in this!,"I know all the purge films have a semi political agenda, what with it being led by the NFFA, but this prequel to the series is racially political. Apparently, nearly all impoverished black Americans are willing to resort to extreme crime to solve their money issues, not only that, but there are no poor white people in the Staten Island community. This film not only plays far too much into the hands of stereotypes, it's also badly written, badly executed-and with the exception of a few cast members-really badly acted. I only made it half way through before my constant eye rolling became so painful I had to turn it off",1.0,22 April 2019
Fun as hell!,"I found this prequel to ""The Purge"" to be one of the more entertaining films in the franchise. Growing up in The Bronx it was refreshing to see a horror movie take place in the projects of Staten Island, as opposed to the usual suburbs we see in most horror films. But don't get it twisted, this isn't ""Purge in the hood"". By that I mean it's not a parody. Its laughable, yes, and not by any means a profound film. I did, however, find it to be a smart way of showing of how the Purge came about. Other than that, check your brain at the door for an entertaining film and even creepy at times. Its a fun B-Film, don't expect anything more.",,2 March 2020

Second half of the film was much better, some good action scenes took place and it was just overall a lot better than the first 45 mins or so. Some questionable decisions made by the main characters which bugged me, which I won't spoil. But it's not game changing.

I'm not even sure why this film is considered horror. It doesn't have the jumpscares for younger people, doesn't have much of a story for adults. In fact, the screenplay is pretty convoluted. The film makes a drug lord from the streets of Staten Island the hero in this movie by fighting back trained black-ops type of mercenaries, Russian soldiers, cops, biker gangs, White, Black, and Red hooded Klansman, Quadcopters that shoot bullets at citizens and his own drug thugs who hire to hoes to snuff him out. Kinda reminds me of Mel Brooks films but without the funny parts. The story is consistently interrupted by fake news footage and politicians on TVs.

"Okay on it's own, bland compared to the first three installments.","'The First Purge' is the fourth installment of the Purge franchise, and is a prequel which takes us back all the way to when the first purging happened: as an experiment staged in Staten Island which served as a precursor to what is now known as an annual event. People were asked to participate in exchange for money if and when they survive the 12 hour experiment, where any form of killing becomes legal. The movie tells us that purging is anti-poor and that people in power will use whatever means possible in order to either exploit them and make more money or eliminate them if they are determined as useless and is contributing to the depletion of valuable resources. So the question is, if it was you, would you have stayed for the money or flee to safety?

The movie in a way is still a testament to the current political climate, where in order for one party to succeed the other must suffer. No ifs, ands or butts. You're either for or against an idea, but the concept of being critical but still in support of the administration is considered alien and unfathomable. Unfortunately this is a little lost in the storytelling which focused heavily on the background of the characters involved, making the 98 minute affair a little bland compared to its predecessors. Maybe explaining how it all started lessened the fear factor because we know the motivation and therefore can process why what's happening is happening. Not knowing what's going on is half of what scares us, the other is finding out and not being able to do anything about it.

Aside from this, there is a Purge TV series released the same year, and a fifth and apparently the final movie set for next year. While the idea seems saturated, there are still more stories to be told and I wouldn't be surprised if there's a reboot a couple of years from now. Until then all we can do is wait out the 12-hour period and hope that next year they can make The Purge great again.",6.0,22 March 2020

I will give it to the director I really liked the way some of the scenes were filmed. The humor that was injected in when the purge first starts made sense and was enjoyable.

A Mess,"The movies in the Purge series are far from being art, but they have followed a formula, have been semi-consistent, and have been fun in a thriller/horror kind of way. This one is just a complete mess though. They seemed be be torn between the old formula, or making an over the top action movie. Some of the action sequences, mainly fight scenes, would be right up there with some of the most over the top cheesy 90's action movies. That could be maybe overlooked, but the characters have seem to have borderline super powers when it comes to the ridiculous fight scenes. In a light-hearted action movie, this can be fun, but it just makes no sense in this film. All the stuff that was campy in the previous films is just taken to full on stupidity territory in this one. Combined with the awful pacing, it makes a 90 minute film feel like it's 3 hours long. And the oddest part, due to the very weak plot the Purge part of the film actually seemed like the worst part.

I actually enjoyed it...!,"Right let's be straight it was never gonna get an Oscar but other reviews are stating there's no story...! I'm sure I've watched three of these films already and in these it's clearly explained the story so this Doesn't need it, it starts as an experiment with clear intentions. I enjoyed the actors performances as they rolled through this night of chaos. It's as always fixed on a line-up of, I found likeable characters with a standard story for a bit of background character building (nothing Oscar worthy) but enjoyable!

What I can't understand is the reviews being negative all the time on here. If you've gone out your way to see the movie then surely you've at least seen a previous one. In no way is this a boring or dull film it is what it is. I personally don't believe you can give all these movies a 1 I've only ever watched a 100 films out of thousands I'd give lower than a 2. It's a new fresh look by taking us back to the first purge with some good acting and some clever little ideas. If people are giving 1,s they should think about stopping in and reading a book instead. If your going to watch a film called meg for instance don't right a review saying it's unrealistic because it's got a 70ft shark in, of course it's unrealistic...!

I wouldn't go and watch another 3 of the same films it's clearly not for you... but if you like this sort of film give it a go I'd seriously give it a 5-6 and it really didn't loose any points on the acting or even directing it was what I expected and a tiny bit more...!",6.0,18 September 2018

A prequel no one asked for,"If you thought the Purge series had run its course, here comes the prequel.

The First Purge is a Blaxploitation inspired parody of Trump's America.

Making America Great Again means getting rid of the underclass. The poor, the ethnic minorities.

When the US economy dives, the two party system collapses and a new movement takes over. The New Founding Fathers of America is the alt right group that is elected.

Dr May Updale (Marisa Tomei) is the Architect of this First Purge set in Staten Island. To her this is a grisly social experiment worth doing if it reduces crime and restores the economy.. Local people have been offered money to take part on purge night.

On the night of the first purge in Staten Island. Some people want to settle scores, others want to party. Dr Updale discovers that someone else wants people to die and are giving assistance to it.

I am not sure having a drug kingpin as the anti hero is the way to go. The film is rather dumb, the series has lost its shock value. The action is fine once it gets going. Even as a satire it could had been done better. It is sad to see Oscar winner Tomei reduced to this kind of movies.",4.0,8 March 2019

Instead of spending money on sequels they should invest that money in a totally new story because let's be honest it's never going to be good anymore.

The purge is political!? Sighing loudly.. anyway i wouldn't say it's a good film. Potentially slightly better than election year?? Just because i like that this one fills in some of the gaps in the purge lore and most importantly makes clear the answer to the thought that 'well, if this actually happened in real life would there really be That much murder?' the only thing is that i personally didn't really have any interest in was skeletor, found him a bit of a goofy plot point but maybe that was just because of the way all the eyes were edited when they go purge mode. I found the tension does really start to pick up especially in that last section which was very action-packed and tense. I think this was perhaps the most i have liked the characters as a whole, i don't think there was anyone that particularly got on my nerves this time around. So yeah it's a decent film really!!

Film Review: The First Purge/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"""Think of all the good the purge does.""

In 2013, the world was introduced to a small little independent horror film called The Purge. The basis of the film revolves around the idea that, for a twelve hour period, one day out of the year in the United States, citizens, residents and all Americans are able to do whatever it is that they like, without any punishment or laws, including and not limited to; violence, vandalism, theft, rape and of course murder. While the first purge film in the series was revolutionary and kick started a franchise that is now in its fourth entry, the first film unfortunately limited itself to being, quite simply, a thrasher home invasion film with the world of the purge harrowingly surrounding it; the potential for the series was behemoth. Thankfully, the film gained steam and momentum, and more films followed, with the original director and writers on board. With the second entry, the world of the purge was explored to the streets of Los Angeles, where motives of revenge and redemption were explored and showed how regular people handled the deadliest night in America. In The Purge: Election Year, the purge got more political (not that it never was), especially since the looming potential of a somewhat clueless President was on the verge of being elected (he didn't actually win, did he?).

Politics and tongue-in-cheek social/economically charge commentary is something that the purge series isn't stranger to, especially within the last two entires in the series. But like any good planned B-Movie film series, the fourth entry in the series is also, technically speaking, the first movie in the series, a prequel. The First Purge is an interesting cinematic approach in terms of shock value, only because, the build up of whether the purge is a successful experiment is answered within minutes of the first film, so what is the point of this film?

Writer and original director of the first three entries, James DeMonaco, who's love child is basically this series, decides to use the first purge film to show the divide between people and their thoughts on this ""experiment"". Sanctioned by the New Founding Fathers of America, the newest political party, who is coincidentally backed any the NRA (National Rifle Association), and developed by scientist Dr.Updale (Marisa Tomei), ""the experiment"" (the initial name for the purge) was only taking place on Staten Island, one of America's lowest income and poorly populated cities (coincidence). If you stay on the island, you get paid $5,000. If you participate in the experiment, you get monetary compensation; if you kill someone, well then you get compensated generously. These are all incentives for the residents of Staten Island.

While we quickly become familiar with the main inhabitants of Staten Island, we are also introduced to all the family drama happening on the island as well, for instance, the main protestor and the purge's biggest rival is the educated and powerfully independent Nya (Lex Scott Davis), whose ex boyfriend Dimitri (Y'lan Noel) is Staten Island biggest gangster, and who's brother Isaiah (Jovian Wade) is secretly joining in the purge's festivities, to get back at a local crack addict for nearly cutting open is throat. While the streets belong to Dimitri, his heart still belongs to Nya, despite their past and current relationship woes.

As the experiment commences, we quickly see that many of the people involved and brave enough to withstand staying, spend most of their time praying, socializing or partying on the island. With the exception of the freaky looking crack head Skeletor (Rotimi Paul), who fashioned himself his own Freddy Kruger inspired claws made out of needles, Staten Island and its residents aren't really purging as expected, unless you consider trap-music inspired street festivals as purging. So, like any good social/political experiment gone wrong in the United States, the government intervenes and sends out their own ""citizens"", ex-mercenaries to kill and rid of low-income residents on Staten Island and cleanse the American genome. You can imagine, Dimitri, the only resident on Staten Island who profits from other people's misery, isn't happy when the government decides to take out his clientele, so, like any good business owner, who goes out himself to rid of his corporate competition.

There are many things wrong with the First Purge including the film's main antagonist and protagonists. Perhaps thats the point, I mean, even the woman who developed the purge has her own scene of redmeption, but then again, how is a person redeemed of concieving such a diabolical experiment, especially when she sells it to the most corrupt clients in the world, the American government? Dimitri is hailed as the films main hero by the times the credits roll, but no matter how many ""baddies"" are killed by his hands, and no matter how many friends he saves, Dimitri is basically the purge 364 days in the year, so making him a hero for a day is less than convincing.

While The First Purge had the potential to be one of the stronger films in the series, it is by far one of the weakest and easily the most B-Movie of them all. While the residents of Staten Island truly inherit a mess of a political system and all its whacky ideas, The First Purge film, inherits a very poorly constructed and thought-out prequel foundation that suffers from surface level thought, relevance and most of all, excitement. While much of the film is lathered Uber-violence, blood and extreme gore, The First Purge is easily the most violent and has the least amount to say.

While the film has many redeeming qualities, including Dimitri, a certified bad-ass and Rambo inspired anti-hero, as well as some very harrowing ideas and thoughts that are revealed with regards to the current status of civil divide and racist plaguing America as this review is written, it is clear that director Gerard McMurray wanted to make a purge film that pushed the idea of ""black power"" into the purge series. Not only does it work effortlessly, but the film also succeeds at showing just how not far off what we see on screen is happening in real life.

The First Purge is an excruciating film experience; not because what is seen on screen at the multiplexes, but whats seen on screen in our own homes on news channels each and every day.",6.0,30 October 2018
Hard to continue,"This movie was hardly ever engaging. The ghetto/project perspective was decently interesting for awhile. Until the purge started in the movie. The movie became less about a social experiment that fans of the movie loved and turned into a weird moral superior, political propaganda film. Where the ganstas and old heads of the hood on Staten Island band up together to kill mercenaries hired by the ""Founding Fathers"" to kill poor black people to fix the economy of the american country. (How 2018)

So what you have is a very washed up script that doesn't have much psychological thriller aspects to it and instead turns into a normal ""rise up"" movie with political bias and race bait themes. Probably to compete with movies like ""Get Out"".

There was even a unnecessary ""Pussy Grabbing"" scene. Which I'm guessing was a Trump reference.",4.0,19 October 2019
Don't know what all the negativity is about.....,"This review section must be filled with easily offended conservatives because all I've heard is complaining about the political devices in this movie.

That's honestly something I belive the movie did very right. They showed the growing divide between the upper and lower class and those who support the purge and those who don't. This is something that is currently plaguing our nation and I think this was huge for a movie like this to use it as a plot point because it made it seem almost plausible for something like this to happen when America is at its worst.

The acting was great in my opinion, and I thought that I really connected and felt for the main characters and was routing for them throughout the movie whereas in previous movies I found myself caring very little about a lot of the main characters and their well-being.

Overall I recommend this movie for sure. Was it my favorite? I wouldn't say that. Would I actually give it 10 stars if my goal here wasn't to piss off all those giving it one star? Probably not, I would say a solid 7 or 8 would do it justice just fine. But I think it's a worthwhile movie to watch if you want to see where the purge came from, what fueled it, and quite honestly what exactly the true message the directors have been trying to get across this entire time is.",10.0,9 July 2018
"A few strong setpieces sprinkled throughout, but lacking in tension, drive, cohesion, or character","Following a prolonged period of financial collapse and civil unrest, the radical political faction the New Founding Fathers becomes the dominant political party seizing control of the United States. The New Founding Fathers create an initiative where they will test an ""experiment"" in Staten Island, New York where all crime will be legal for a 12 hour period including murder. Those who agree to stay on the island are promised $5,000 assuming they survive with additional incentives for participation. Among the residents we follow are Nya (Lex Scott Davis) an anti-purge activist living in the Park Hill housing project looking after her younger brother Isaiah (Joivan Wade). Nya tries to protect her brother from the influences of her kingpin ex-boyfriend Dmitri Cimber (Y'lan Noel). All three prepare for the purge in different ways with Nya shepherding anti-purgers to safety in the local church, Dimitri corralling the more unruly elements in his gang, and Isaiah intends to kill unhinged junkie Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) in retribution for cutting him. Meanwhile the President's Chief of Staff, Arlo Sabian(Patch Darragh), monitors the Staten Island experiment from a safe distance and takes measures to ensure the experiment is successful.

Following the end of The Purge: Election Year, it seemed almost like it precluded further installments in the franchise save for maybe the few remnant New Founding Father believers mentioned over the closing credits. Franchise creator and director of first three Purge films, James DeMonaco, announced after Election Year that the next installment would be a prequel showing the origins of The Purge. This was honestly a point I was hesitant on because prequels are inherently handicapped by the fact the audience knows how they'll end because they need to end a certain way so it makes sense and lines up with prior installments (assuming you don't just throw up your hands and say ""screw it"" as was the case with Prometheus and the Star Wars prequels). Prequels can work, but in order to distract the audience from the foregone conclusion you have to either have a story worth telling or characters who are engaging.... The First Purge has few of those things.

Unlike the first three Purges, and that includes the ""first"" The Purge, the film has a major problem with pacing, focus and drive. For the first 40 minutes of the movie there's nothing really driving the plot forward with much of the opening focusing on Nya protesting or shepherding people to shelter, Isaiah doing reckless gangland actions followed by ill-advised revenge actions (which are mostly directionless and ultimately pointless), and Dimitri locking down his businesses and underlings. It's a flabby unfocused screenplay especially since our three lead characters don't tie together until well over an hour into this 90 minute movie. The first hour feels like padding, the sequences in the observation office monitoring the experiment serve no real purpose other than to espouse information that has already been well established since the 2nd film and no new revelations are given here meaning it's just spoon-feeding what was already told to us. The movie's primary antagonist in the first third is an obnoxiously over the top Rotimi Paul as Skeletor and not only is he grating, the movie basically forgets about him once the mercenaries dressed like gangs and far right extremists storm the island until he comes back as a rather stupid Deus Ex Machina.

I will say that while the opening hour of the movie is a directionless mess, the final half hour almost has salvageable value. Dimitri eventually figures out there's Mercenaries on the island and basically becomes reluctant protector picking off the mercenaries and saving Staten Islanders. This eventually culminates in a climax where he needs to storm the Park Hill housing projects alone against the mercenaries sweeping the building to save Nya and Isaiah and the movie becomes reminiscent of The Raid and actually becomes entertaining with Y'lan Noel doing quite well as a morally grey action hero. The last half hour was really well done and actually felt like it could've been grounds for expansion to the whole movie rather than just tucked away in the final third but that's what they did. This climax alone doesn't make the movie ""good"" per se, but it did show there was at least some ideas at play which certainly makes it slightly better than the dull and overly contained The Purge, not by much but a little.

The First Purge is a very ""meh"" entry in the series. It doesn't offer any new information on the world of The Purge or do anything all that different from the previous two entries and is lacking in both strong characterization or narrative drive leaving the film feeling flabby and directionless. The movie does become more engaging in the climax thanks to a setpiece that brings to mind the likes of The Raid or other claustrophobic action thrillers, but with only a half-hour of good and over an hour of grating directionless mediocrity it's not really strong justification. If you enjoy the series you'll find stuff to like here, but it doesn't reach the level of Election Year or Anarchy.",5.0,28 September 2021

The trailer turned out to be about much better than the movie.. There is no coherent plot, the acting is wooden and stereotypical, and like in all cheap trash horror movies out there, there is no common sense or logic. I don't want to focus on the negatives, as there are so many of them. It could have been good. They just needed to add a few subplots, some logic and development and to leave the gore and horror, but make it a bit more realistic and believable, so that the idea of class struggle and the politicians against the people is plausible.

And in the third, you had Frank Grillo, who has a great presence about him and can really shine in a franchise like this. I'm not necessarily saying the actors were bad here, but they didn't have that same presence. Also, the main ""hero"" is a gang leader and we're asked to root for him.... not the best character description for the protagonist. The action was more generic than I cared for, although there were some good scares that got me. I will say that I liked the main female protagonist as a character and I liked Marisa Tomei in her role, to be honest I would've liked to see more of her.

& HOPEFULLY THE LAST PURGE...!,The hit series has decided to reverse the clock by giving us a prequel tracing the very first purge trial held in Staten Island where the powers that be used open violence to wreck havoc on the powerless & disenfranchised in the name of a human course correction which ultimately'll serve the greater good of the masses. Yeah they can spew this nonsense till they're blue in the face but this borderline fascist manifesto masquerading as mainstream entertainment slips a little too easily in the mantra currently being chanted by the powerful in our country.

"Regular prequel , middlingly paced ,with lots of thrills , violence , gore and guts","Passable prequel , but inferior to former entries , being set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future with chills, shocks and loads of violence . This thrilling picture results to be a futuristic yarn full of kinetic energy and amazing stunt work . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , and a weird atmosphere with dark with a surprising ending . The known and unrealistic premise of ""The Purge"" developing in the first installment is the following : The idea behind this whole futuristic America is that the Economy is down and Crime is up , as authorities put a lot of emphasis on murder being legal , that's why they believe assassinations would get better problems . It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these troubles is built up aggression within the human population. In order to correct this, the United States Government testing a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community . As the goverment decides that it would be a good idea to give the public a day to ""release the aggression"". So, one day of each year, they will have an annual ""Purge"" where all crime is legal , including killing . Somehow, magically, this does help the Economy and Crime overall is down for the rest of the year. Because if people get out all that anger in one day , they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year . Sometime in the 21st century, turmoil has caused the government to be overthrown by the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA). This third installment revolves around the first annual purge night , organized by the party nowadays governs : The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) . NFFA members Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) and Dr. May Updele (Marisa Tomei) announce an experiment to take place on Staten Island where for 12 hours, people will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose . The NFFA offers residents of the Island $5000 to stay in their homes during the purge and a compensation for those participating as well . They also give the participants a peculiar outfit : tracking devices , contact lenses with cameras in them so that they can monitor all activity . While Drug lord Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) tells his dealers that they will be leaving ; however , the dangerous drug dealer Capital A (Christian Robinson) wishes to stay and purge . A crazed drug addict named Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) talks on camera about his dark thoughts , including his desire to ""purge"" and unleash his hatred on other citizens . Later on , another young drug dealer, Isaiah (Joivan Wade) , gets into a struggle with Skeletor . Meantime , the good mother Luisa (Luna Lauren Velez) is looking for her child . After that , Isaiah goes to his sister Nya (Lex Scott Davis) , an anti-Purge activist and Dimitri's ex-sweetheart, for treatment, and Nya later confronts Dmitri as she believes that Dmitri is Isaiah's drug lord , which he denies . Along the way some people have to confront a really ruthless gang of masked killers . Citizens , join the first Purge .Purged . For one night only, America invites you to its annual tradition . Keep America Great .Purge for the People .Purge for the Nation . Purge for the Power .Purge for Your Liberty . Purge for the Glory. Witness the birth of an American tradition. Citizens, join the Purge. A nation reborn. It Changed Our Country. It Challenged Our Beliefs. Now, Witness How It All Began. Witness the birth of an American tradition. It Changed Our Country. It Challenged Our Beliefs. Now, Witness How It All Began. The movement that begun as a simple experiment...

The film is a comic-books style story , set in a dystopian nearly future , plenty of energetic action , shootouts , extreme violence , thriller , surprise-filled entertainment and high body-count . The tale is a blending of ordinary Sci-Fi movies , such as : Escape from N.Y , 2013 : Rescue in L.A. , Doomsday , and even Mad Max series , taking parts here and there . Instead of attempting to be a terror movie , it turns a fantastic thriller/action film set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future about a group of people trying to survive on a night where it's all-out war on the streets . It displays a motley plethora of characters , pretty well but succintly drawn , giving ordinary performances by its entire cast . This stirring movie is packed with frenetic action , crossfire , tension , thrills , chills , and lots of blood and gore , including throating-slit , cold-blood shots , beheading and anything else . The nail-biting action scenes are uniformly very well done , and the suspense and intrigue are enough to keep you interested throughout the film runtime , even in the low parts of the picture . This so-so Action Thriller was the third movie in the ""Purge"" trilogy (2013-2018) and the first was ¨The Purge¨with Ethan Hawke , Lena Headey , following : ¨Purge : Anarchy¨ that even has earned more money at the box office than its predecessor , starred by Frank Grillo , Carmen Ejogo , Zach Gilford , John Beasley , Kiele Sanchez , Justina Machado , Edwin Hodge ; third ¨Purge Election¨ with Kyle Secor , Frank Grillo , Elizabet Mitchell until this prequel was made : The First Purge (2018) .

This horror/action-adventure film from director Gerard McMurray serves as a former prequel to explain the deeds that caused this violent first purge . This is a decent movie and well set in a post-apocalyptic D.C. , dealing with citizens who will have to fight cruel disguised cutthroats , bands of depraved crazies ; packing frantic action , shocks as well as abundant violence, being professionaly produced by James de Monaco . As James De Monaco is really the true author of the Purge trilogy , Monaco is a good writer/producer and director . He has written the Purge saga and Purge TV series ; and wrote Assault on Precinct 13 , Skinwalkers , Negotiator , Hate , Staten Island , The kill Point series , Crash series . And he has directed The Purge films ; this horror/thriller franchise is formed by The Purge 2013 , The Purge: Anarchy 2014 , Election year 2016 , and The First Purge 2018 . All of them are set in different locations , as the first film takes place in a house , the second film takes place in the streets , and the third film takes place in official locations , as well as D.C. , and The First Purge takes place on Staten Island, New York , in which no character from any of the previous installments will be returning. This ¨First Purge¨ 2018 was shot in Buffalo, NY and doubled as Staten Island, NY ; it results to be an acceptable but mediocre film in its own right and it's worth watching for saga fans , only . Rating : 5/10 . It is highly recommend to anyone who appeals apocalyptic thrillers .",5.0,30 December 2019
The 1* Reviews Are More Of A Problem Than The Film Itself,"Numerous individuals cannot fathom a situation where The Purge would begin as an experiment in a working-class area where individuals are starving for money and lacking opportunity. The income wage gap in the United States is terrible, and the film itself creates an alternative timeline where situations are direr for the middle and working-class than they are in our reality.

The movie isn't 'politically charged' yet, much like the first film of the franchise, it exposes those who are trapped in a narrow frame of mind. The plot explains everything several reviewers complain over.

However, there were points in the plot where the writing was lazy, the narrative failed to tell a complex story, and the movie ends earlier. The acting was pretty good, with Y'lan Noel and Lex Scott Davis putting on good performances.

Overall, it's an okay prequel that needed more depth, but isn't anywhere near as problematic as those who have a problem with the melanin content of some of the antagonists.

"""Pray. Not Purge""... The franchise needs new ideas","""The First Purge"" (2018 release; 97 min.) is the latest (4th) installment in the ""Purge"" franchise. As the movie opens, we learn that the New Founding Fathers of America party has risen to power, and in order to solidify their power, are wanting to experiment with a new social program that would allow any and all criminal behavior for a 12 hour period. We then go to ""Staten Island - Two Days Before the Experiment"", and we get to know a number of the movie's main characters, including a brother and sister, a drug ring leader and several others. Tensions rise as we get closer to the experiment... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: James DeMonaco, the writer-director-creator of the franchise, leaves directing duties to Gerard McMurray, whom I have never heard of. Let me say upfront that I have seen the prior three ""Purge"" movies, and that I have enjoyed these in the strangest of ways. Indeed, the idea of a real life ""purge"" night seems super scary to me. However, I did not enjoy this latest installment and I will tell you why: for whatever reason the movie makers, or at least DeMarco, thought that it would be a good idea in this day and age to play up racial divisions and not only that, but depicting them in a way that is reminiscent of the KKK and neo-Nazis. For shame. It is absolutely not fine as far as I'm concerned. What once was a franchise about surviving the night, now has become a (semi)political movie about racism and racial divides. As to the cast, it is a mostly no-names and mostly African-American cast, one of the big exceptions being Marisa Tomei, yes, THE Marisa Tomei (playing the role of the person who came up with the idea of the purge).

""The First Purge"" opened wide once again on the July 4 holiday. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was packed to the rafters. Most people in the audience were African-American. I, for one, am done with this franchise. At one point in the movie a church sign in Staten Island reads ""Pray. Not Purge"", as people are getting savaged left and right. The ""Purge"" franchise badly needs some new ideas, as far as I'm concerned. Bottom line: I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience. If you are interested in the concept of the ""purge"", by all means check out one of the prior three movies, but stay away from this one.",3.0,11 July 2018

The First Purge will be my last purge,"I somehow kept stuffing up the name of this film and calling it The Last Purge, which in a way, was prophetic, because it wasn't enjoyable and will be the last film in the Purge franchise I subject myself to.

Some of the previous films had been almost a guilty pleasure of mine. Fairly original concept, intense and like a less fantasy-driven version of 'The Hunger Games'. In this prequel, the characters are less likeable than ever, with it almost impossible to feel invested in their safety or plight.

This film is the definition of mindless, over-the-top violence. Its political themes and current-day references are no longer subtle and just come across as crass. As an Australian, I felt so far removed from any agenda this was trying to push that it just seemed too foreign . Kind of sad that these films still get green-lighted in a time of almost constant mass shootings over in the States.

Steer clear or wait for the dvd release,"Prior to going to watch The Purge I looked at reviews and seen the negative feed back. However, I still decided to give it a go because my sister works at the theater and got us both in free and I wouldn't have to waste money.

All though I didn't waste the money, I regret wasting my time with the movie. The movie was lacking in multiple aspects and just fell short. The plot of a first purge could have been awesome, but it just wasn't. The story seemed to shift way too much between multiple plots instead of providing a quality overarching story for the audience. Acting was flat for the most part, but some of it seems to be due to the behind the scenes staff and writing. Parts of the movie seemed cheesy and laughable. Some parts can be ignored, while others will have you shaking your head. There were some cool aspects of the movie, but not enough to warrant the movie with a solid rating.

All in all, the movie was a bust in my opinion. I enjoyed the two previous purge movies, and was disappointed that this one was just mediocre. I would recommend waiting for the movie to come to redbox before checking it out if you want to watch it.

The First Purge Makes Me Wonder About You Humans,"I can't say I like the ""Purge"" movie. I don't understand why a human would want to kill another human. Being a cat we do get into fights but nobody usually kills anyone.

""The First Purge"" tells the story of how this crazy experiment started. The event started in Staten Island, New York . They paid residents $5000.00 to stay on the island for the event. I watched some of the other Purge movies and they always have these strange looking people running the event.

Marisa Tomei, who usually ends up in better movies plays ""Dr.Updale"" who created the experiment. It was ordered by the ""New Founding Fathers of America"", the political party that overtook the country. It kind of reminds of the ""Trump"" adminstration.

""Arlo Sabian"" The Founding Fathers Adminstration Chief of Staff played by Patch Darragh added some more stuff to the experiment and did some pretty awful things.

To keep as many citizens alive the hero of the movie was ""Dmitri"" played by Y'lan Noel. He was actually a local gangster but became a local hero when people started killing his friends as part of the experiment. ""N'ya"" played by Lex Scot Davis was a protestor telling people not to participate. She was joined by her brother ""Isaiah"" played by Joivan Wade. Other people fighting the fight included her neighbor ""Delores"" played by ""Mugga""

The movie had the strangest images of people dressed up in all sorts of characters. What made me happy is that I didn't see any cats or dogs purging, which is good. There were no pets in the movies at all. If they showed a dead cat or dog Mom would freak out.

She shared with me that her Dad, My Human Grand Dad, actually walked out of ""Dances With Wolves"" when the wolf died. He could not stand any animals to be killed. Mom inherited the same gene.

Politically-divisive insulting drivel,"It goes without saying that we live in divisive times.

I'd wager that there's a representative portion of society that would almost certainly argue that the idea of a Purge being imposed upon the population at this particular juncture in time might not be so fanciful an idea after all.

We are all tumbling helplessly into a neo-fascist far-right wing superstate after all, didn't you hear?

Set on Staten Island, New York City, Gerard McMurray's film tells of the build up to and events of the very first purge, upon whose experimental 'successes' all subsequent purges were to be based.

As ever, the whole notion of a human purge is an incredibly intriguing idea upon which to base a motion picture. and this probably explains why I have retained at least a cursory interest in this frequently misfiring franchise.

Sadly, The First Purge is not just a bad film, it's by far and away the worst film I've had the misfortune to witness in quite some time. Its poisonous cocktail of B-Movie sensibilities and enormously contrived narrative, blend like out-of-date soya milk and cold coffee to produce a lumpen misshapen cliche-riddled pile of old bollocks.

To add insult to injury, the whole sorry episode plays out like an ill-informed simplistic brain-washed sixth form school project done on behalf of their class tutor, who just so happens to be a fully paid-up member of the Democratic Party of the United States of America.

Rabid Democratic political bias dominating the narrative of a Hollywood motion picture? Whatever next?!!

Now, whatever your political persuasion may be, being rattled by this film's relentless and shameless ideological political jackhammer for 98 minutes, is not an experience I would recommend in any sort of a hurry.

To summarise: White men are all evil Republicans intent upon suppressing ethnic minorities and installing some kind of totalitarian fascist super state upon us all. And everyone else - serial killers and drug-dealing gang bosses included - are simply victims of an unjust society, and just fine.

In these times of such fractious divisions in society, more than ever the arts have a real part to play in providing honesty. How good would it be if mainstream films like this made an effort to heal and encourage constructive dialogue between politically-divided people?

Unfortunately, sensationalist offerings such as The First Purge are evidently completely disinterested in offering any sort of olive branch of reconciliation, and do nothing but titillate and segregate the 'them and us' still further.

No matter what positives Gerard McMurray's agenda-driven nonsense occasionally throws up - and there are admittedly a few ideas and set pieces strewn about the place which stick in the memory - The First Purge, on balance, is nothing more than poorly made propaganda-laced self-congratulatory virtuous twaddle that succeeds only in dragging an already patchy franchise kicking and screaming through the cinematic gutter.

"Decent prequel. ""The First Purge"" is on par with the rest of the series","""The Purge"" is one of those film-franchises that likes to confuse people by not numbering the sequels. So, in fact, ""The First Purge"" is actually the fourth, and I'm not too sure if I already saw the third one. Then again, it doesn't really matter in what order you watch them, and this is prequel.

In ""The First Purge"", the freshly elected NFFA (New Founding Fathers of America) are about to dry-run their idea of the purge on Staten Island. For a period of 12 hours, all types of crime - including murder - are legal. With the exception of a handful of freaky people, the residents of Staten Island don't seem very eager to kill each other, but the NFFA has a back-up plan to make their project successful anyway.

Nothing in ""The First Purge"" qualifies as original or surprising. Street hoodlums into heroes, and the politicians in the ivory towers are the real monsters. It's clichéd, but at least the film is never boring and chock-full of explicit violence and sinister masks.",5.0,8 November 2021
The Start...,"""The First Purge"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch an American political party called the New Founding Fathers of America making an experiment on Staten Island. This experiment is called Purge and the people who will survive from a twelve hours period with no laws will take five thousand dollars. This movie shows us how all started and takes us back at the start of The Purge.

I liked this movie because it was interesting, it had a nice plot and some very good scenes. I enjoyed the fact that it presented us the start of the purge and explained us everything behind that experiment because it made me see everything from a different perspective now that I know the truth behind it. The direction which was made by Gerard McMurray it was very good and is obvious in the whole duration of it that he did a great job. Regarding the interpretations, I liked the interpretation of Y'lan Noel who played as Dmitri, Lex Scott Davis who played as Nya and Mugga who played as Dolores and gave something different in this horror movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Marisa Tomei's who played as The Architect - Dr. Updale and Patch Darragh's who played as Chief of Staff - Arlo Sabian.

Finally, I have to say that ""The First Purge"" is a nice movie to watch with an interesting plot and some plot twists that you won't expect, something that makes this movie even more interesting. Under the guidance of James DeMonaco who was the director of the three previous purge movies, Gerard McMurray's direction is equally good. If you have already watched the previous three movies then I am sure that you are going to enjoy this movie too.",5.0,25 January 2019

After the complete train-wreck of a third that was 'Election Year' this movie brought the franchise back to life and gave it more of an understanding. They delve into why people do the things they do when they purge, what people thought was and wasn't acceptable when the 'social experiment' first arose... yeah ok, so the movie has its clichè moments, but some of the issues they touch on are very much real life... the struggle for people with little to no income, the things people would do to gain income at such a time, and the way that the government can pretty much do anything to make themselves look good.

The First Purge is the First Letdown of the Series,"It became a tradition with my mom and my nephew to see these Purge movies. We all enjoyed the last one and we all agreed that since we had so much fun with these films, let's make it a tradition!

Then comes First Purge....

It started out okay. It opened with this drugged out black dude with this messed up head who goes by the name Skeletor, go all crazy and talk about killing people. In front of him is this conservative white dude in glasses. He hears Skeletor say the word purge so I'm guessing this moment inspires the rest of the films.... I guess.

So now we see a bunch of news reels and they are conducting an experiment in Staten Island, New York for the first purge event. Poor people are getting paid to stay there and this whole thing is head by Marisa Tomei and some other white dude in a big control room full of other white dudes. I can almost get behind all this because I can see the government targeting poor people and minorities. Heck, they use race baiting on the news to distract them from political events.

Then we meet a young black kid named Isiah. He gets harassed by Skeletor and suddenly gets cut. His friend helps him out by shooting at him, and Isiah gets all mad. After this we are introduced to the hero of this film, the main guy, a drug king pin named Dmitri, who has a group of guys working with him and he nearly kills one of his own. I honestly thought he was the villain of this movie, but we soon learn that this is who we are following. His sister (or lover, I missed what she was to him) N'ya is upset with him, but Dmitri shows he cares about her and Isiah and he will protect them on the night of the purge.

Of course, he doesn't. Isiah goes out into the night wearing those weird looking eye contacts and is searching for Skeletor. Apparently Skeletor is too busy killing girls at a party, but Isiah finally has a gun to his head and doesn't pull the trigger. Instead, he runs. This endangers his sister as she leaves the church to go looking for him leading to a very stupid scene that we all agreed with where they are talking in the middle of the street instead of hiding. Of course they run into trouble.

Everything was fine in this film up to a point. I was enjoying the imagination of the costumes, and there were some creative ideas. But then you realize that this movie is about race baiting. Suddenly there are Klu Klux Klan members, white cops beating a black dude like Rodney King in this baseball stadium, slow motion shots of black people being set on fire, and I'm just waiting for slavery to make an appearance. Then you start to realize that the movie is sending out a message that white people are bad, and the black people are the way they are because of the white people. I hate these kinds of films and for such an enjoyable series, why did they go this route?

The last act of the movie was rather dull. I was never really invested in the characters, save for maybe N'ya and Delores, but for everyone else I could care less about. As the film closes, I couldn't really see how this would tie into the other films and felt unnecessary. If you stay in the credits, they advertise The Purge TV series. I think they are a little late on that concept. This movie destroyed any future this series might have.",4.0,11 July 2018
Absolute Trash - Avoid,"Considering I loved the first 3 I paid extra to see this in a fully kitted out cinema. What a waste of time and money that was. The opening Scene had me already wondering about the stereotypes and implications we were about to endure but I had no idea How much this would continue throughout. The concept that poor blacks and Hispanics will kill each other for money because they are so desperate to escape poverty and the only options are working in a corner shop or selling drugs is just so outdated, stereotypical and bias. I found myself squirming and wanted to look away at this poor excuse for a film. It was almost like a cross between new jack city, menace to society some 80s teenage horror.

All the characters were so 1 dimensional and even the parts were we were supposed to care lacked any real emotion or empathy.

I think what ruined it more than anything was that the whole idea of the purge has always been about decreasing crime and allowing people to purge and get their anger out. The implication of this film was that if America is to survive we need to cleanse the ghetto's of all the people who are making America worse... this undertone of 'making America great again' by targeting the poor and ethnic people is just too close to home and not what this was supposed to be about.

A tedious and unnecessary prequel.,"Probably the most frustrating thing about The Purge franchise is, ironically, it's fantastic premise: an annual law in which all crime is legal for one bloody, chaotic night. On this night, citizens can cave to their most sadistic fantasies, for their isn't any law to restrict them of all their repressed depravities. The Purge (2013) was a decent spin on the home invasion movie, whilst its poor sequels Anarchy (2014) and Election Year (2016) took to the streets and focused on those attempting to survive the night amid the violence. This fourth instalment takes us back to the beginning, in which the Purge itself begins life as an experiment dreamt up by the shady NFFA. To be conducted on Staten Island for one night, those who volunteer to participate in the first purge are instructed to wear contact lenses, so their activity can be monitored throughout the night. Those who option not to participate are granted $5000 in compensation. What frustrates me terribly is that out of the four films built upon such a great idea, is that none of them have come close to living up to the full potential of its premise, and The First Purge is no exception.

Unfortunately, this lacklustre prequel edges closer to the truly disastrous Election Year rather than navigating the franchise into a more interesting direction. Say what you will about the original film, it certainly wasn't great but at least it felt like a coherent piece of work. The First Purge knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. It knows its trash and is totally unapologetic about that fact. Despite all it's gruesome kills and nasty splatter, the film is a stunningly tedious experience that fails to engage. It's a painfully boring ride with one dimensional characters, some truly abysmal cinematography during the action sequences (especially in the third act), and a stunningly dull script. A fourth film in a franchise needs to revitalize the narrative, or else it's destined to fail. What we have here is a carbon copy of the previous two films, only this time with the gimmick of addressing it as a prequel to dress it up as something more interesting than it really is. Don't let the marketing fool you, this isn't an interesting exploration into how one of the craziest annual laws came into fruition; it's just another movie about people killing each other, simply because they can.",2.0,22 July 2018

This One Hits a New Low Level,"The First Purge is exemplary how low the intellectual capacity in Hollywood is nowadays - the ""white"" and ""black"" characters are drawn in such a high level of stereotypes that it almost hurts watching them. The gang-members are the copy of the copy of the copy of some gangsta movie, no better the politicians and other guys and gals around.

The First Purge tries (I at least guess so) to add some more political/social comment/agenda to the story but fails totally: if the people depicted are real life people I would not vote for a Purge but for a pure nuclear distinction of the whole human race ;)

The first Purge was a fine thriller with some sci-fi elements but with every addition to the franchise the level of the movies dropped and dropped. On top the plot is very slowly and all in all boring and tastes like some overdue cheese: till the first real action got the stage you got a lot to struggle with boredom or sleep or with both.

Black Rambo - just as dumb - just as fun,"This prequel goes back to the conception of the Purge. Law and Order is suspended for a limited... Actually if you don't know the concept of the Purge then stop reading this review and get back to your cave.

The Purge kicks off, but people don't have as bigger appetite for murdering their neighbours as the big-cheeses hoped for. So they send in death squads to get the ball rolling. They also didn't count on a plucky bunch of local people and a surprisingly community-spirited drug-dealer .

The Purge franchise can never seem to decide if it wants to be a serious horror/thriller film with a comment on the human condition; or if it wants to be a silly slasher-fest. This one is no exception.

The initial concept is thought provoking and as we get to know the characters we can see how people are being pulled off the line of virtue. The next thing everyone is running around with baseball bats and assault rifles.

The bad guys look like they came via the world's most inappropriate fancy dress shop. We have clown faces, bikers, flasher macs, Gestapo-gimps, Russian paratroopers, even the Klan show up in full regalia - pointy hats and all.

The main protagonist is your typical action hero:suitably ripped, and cuts through bad guys like a kid goes through birthday cake.

Are there plot holes? Oh, yes. Why do the local drug-dealers have an arsenal big enough to hold back the People's Liberation Army? Why hire mercenaries that have trouble fighting, shooting or even standing up when required. Considering the tech they have why send anyone at all? But these sort of things happen in every action film EVER!

This film is pretty average but bounces along with the required amount of zing. The acting and effects are solid enough for TV, there are some nice action sequences, and (most importantly) it ends before things get too silly.

Some people have aired concerns that this movie demonises white people. I personally didn't see that and I wasn't offended- and as a Brit I would direct people to the quote from Greg Walsh - ""In the movies, villains always have British accents - even the Nazis!

Now this film has a different feel and reveals the motivation of the Purge - the annihilation of non-whites by a nationalist right-wing and obviously white government called the New Founding Fathers of America. Really? The makers of this film obviously have a political agenda that can be summed up as whites: bad, black/hispanic/asians good. For God's sake we even have robed KKK killers showing up.

Weakest of the franchise,"I'm a huge fan of this franchise as I think it is a brilliant concept and I loved the previous 3 instalments.

I always wondered as what exactly happened that made the government create this event and this movie was supposed to explain the events that led up to as it is called the first purge.

This movie failed miserably to explain that what caused the first purge experiment and became another one night terror film although we already had 3 films that did that.

This movie had a perfect opportunity to become more of a political thriller where people and politicians are arguing with each other and try to make the purge experiment more convincing and that would of made it the best film of the franchise.

However I't wasn't all bad and I still enjoyed it has another one night terror film and was really dark that made the film a sinister feel to it.",5.0,8 July 2018

Not very interesting,"It's interesting to try and figure out why movies like the Hunger Games or this one or the latter half of the Black Mirror episodes just seem lame and boring, rather than actually being a horrific image of dystopian times that lay ahead of us in the near future (like the early Black Mirror). The answer seems to lie in how movies like this one are situated in current times, while adding something futuristic. The result is a situation that seems to play out in an alternate universe, making it feel very distant from the viewer and thus less scary. The unneeded jumpscares are not gonna change anything there, but are more of a sign of how subpar the writing and direction of this movie are. Characters remain rather undeveloped and the scientific or political layer is paper thin.",3.0,12 December 2022
The first time is always to forget and the same happens with the first purge,"It's just an okay film, more of the same. From a sociological perspective, it's a huge mistake, portrays all poor people or black people as drug dealers and shows the American stereotype that all Russians are evil and dangerous. Also has some plot holes that do not make sense in the story, exaggerates in the action and fails to create suspense. The producers must feel lazy to express their creativity, because they could produce good stories around the premise that all crime is legal for 24 hours and that would originate curious stories with different concepts. For example:

An emotional and psychological horror film that would show two 13-year-old and 10-year-old brothers running away from their home during the purge night, they wanted to watch what happens in the streets with their own eyes. Meanwhile their innocence would be destroyed, their family would try to find them and then they would die in front of the brothers, the kids would have to survive together until the end of that night and deal with the weight of their consequences.








I think some producers have ideas like mine, but they prefer to give us repetitive and two-dimensional stories.

Read rotten tomatoes reviews by ""critics"" after the movie and sometimes I think they don't get it - this isn't an Oscar contender, don't judge it like that, but give it props where they are due, it did spend time developing characters, the story line was engaging, and the action was on point with enough cringe worthy moments to get that Purge feel... and IF you choose to acknowledge it, it goes to a whole other level as it serves up some social commentary on the current political landscape.

"Good decent movie, not you normal narrative and rating has been distorted by the haters due to racial politics","Don't think I've laughed so much in a long time. To explain.

So when it comes to Hollywood, overwhelmingly most movies portray black, ethnic minorities, Johnny foreigner in a negative light unless they are 'saved' and conform to some western norm/ideal. The hero's predominately white with all their character flaws overcome their personal demons to rise to the challenge of the hero.

So in the ultra rare instance when a movie comes along and the white guys are predominately the bad guys while the black guys are the good guys, and in a similar way rise to the challenge, then we see an outpouring of outrage with cries of its racial stereotyping.

Read the comments here on IMDB where the lowest possible star rating is being awarded by the outraged, maybe they need to do the same for the thousands of movie racially stereotyping white is good, black is bad.

This is a lesson in how the veil of tolerance is dropped as it really hits a nerve to be collectively described as the bad guy and when a narrative that has been pushed for centuries is turned on its head.

Maybe it's being collectively demonised as a race?

Maybe it's the uncomfortable truth to the reality of the world, where the main agressor and exploiter of the world for the last few centuries has been white men in the form of colonialism (Brtish, French, Dutch etc) and more recently in this century, US invasion after invasion, regime change after regime change.

Maybe its the parallels drawn in this fictitious dystopian movie to contempory world order, the rise of the far right across the world and in particular the USA, the uncomfortable relationship with the NRA (National Rifle Association), mainstream politics and right wing militias.

Maybe its the relationship between the black community and the very organisations that are meant to protect them but instead they suffer indifference, marginalisation and injustice regularly resulting in being 'purged'.

I say to them here's a movie that has got you to think and respond emotionally, I'm giving the movie a 10/10

As for everyone else watch it, the ratings have been distorted by the haters.",10.0,22 September 2018
Walked out,"As a fan of the initial Purge movie, and given the second was tolerable, I went to see this movie expecting little, but hoping for some enjoyable explanation of how the purge came about and to see some interesting characters and battle royale style action. I could stomach about 30 minutes of this movie before walking out of the theatre to go see Skyscraper due to the fact that seemingly every other word was n**** and the characters were such a pastiche of poor urban communities. Please note I am ok with the use of the ""n"" word when it is either culturally or characteristically relevant to do so or done to enhance the abhorrence of dramatic circumstance (such as in Django Unchained, Hateful Eight, or Training Day).

When the purge finally began at about 25 minutes in to the movie, I had no regard for any of the characters, was unimpressed with the ""skeletor psycho"" (who apparently had not been picked up by any law enforcement or civil service agency to try and help him as he's clearly psychotic), and could not figure out why or how two geriatric women were able to create explosive devices from cuddly toys and old Nokia phones. The contact lenses, that the participants of the purge are made to wear, glow different colours, and for some reason that I didn't, nor do I want to understand, this seemed like a good option for the NFFA - ""hey this event is happening at night, people are going to want to be stealthy, here make your eyes glow in the dark so everyone can see you hiding.""

In summary, it's a waste of studio money where other films which have good scripts and deeper characters are shelved or never made, a poor acting display from all involved, a disappointment for someone of Marissa Tomei's stature, and a really belittling portrayal of ethnic groups.

Avoid this one.",1.0,19 July 2018

"Race and politics aside, this prequel was awesome!","I can't believe all the hate this film has over race and politics. People need to chill out, sit back with a beer and popcorn, and enjoy a film for its merits. All these 1's and 2's are seriously undeserving.

Firstly, the writing was on point and probably had a better story than the other installments - all of which were written by James DeMonaco. It was a great way to set the stage for how the purge all started. This one actually had a full blown story with lots of action, thrills, suspense, horror and romance. Sure, there were some cliches, but still very captivating and entertaining.

Then there's the directing which was great considering this was novice director Gerard McMurray's 2nd full length feature film behind two short films. He did a better job than some seasoned directors messes I've seen lately.

The acting by all cast was excellent - not one actor was unconvincing. I also enjoyed the fight scenes and the VFX and cinematography were all on point.

I hope they come out with a sequel to this prequel on how the purge finally became mandatory nation-wide leading into the first film.

The average review here is fairly accurate,"The entire series hasn't lived up to the hype. The original idea was amazing, but it's steadily gone downhill. It's not as bad as many of the reviewers on here would have you believe but it's certainly not above average quality. I could see this kind of movie being tricky to maintain the balance between having a hero or villain to cheer for or against as they try to create a regular bodycount. But it makes sense from other angles, as such an event would end up being complete chaos with nobody to trust, gangs would establish turf, there would be racial tension and many folks would enact their rage on various groups that they want to blame for the problems in their lives. There should be an evolution from the first year where they wipe out many of the easy/stupid targets and get wiser every year. There's always an influx of stupid people but eventually you'd likely have a growing number of people avoiding the chaos or smarter killers finding more efficient ways to make cash. Sure, there are those killing just to pointlessly kill, but the entire premise of this movie was that people were going to get paid for the chaos.",5.0,23 July 2018

Forgets everything that made the first three films great,"What a bizarre series the 'Purge' films have turned out to be. The first film blew people away with what a great and original idea it was, yet set the entire movie in a house and focused on one family, completely squandering all the potential. Then in the second film they worked out their mistake and made the best film in the series. Then they took a slightly different approach in the third film and decided to introduce a political twist to the mix. This still worked and that was another great film. Then somehow, and God only knows how a mistake this big could be allowed to happen, they decided the fourth film should be a prequel completely lacking in imagination, creativity, originality or any of the things that made the second and third films so great. Astonishing.

'The First Purge' is not a good film. Perhaps I should be happy that it took them until the fourth film to completely muck things up, but that's not how I feel right now. Every single character in this film is completely unlikeable in every way. There is literally not a single person for the audience to root for in this film. Also I'm of the belief that prequels can be a great addition to any series - as longs they add something. They need to enlighten the audience on at least one element. There should be an unforeseen twist of some kind. There was none of that here. It was simply showing the first ever purge and that was it.

The problem with a bad entry in this series is that it exemplifies how dumb of an idea the purge actually is. Up until now the movies have been so fun that we haven't really had time to analyse too deeply just how stupid this concept is, but when a film is as boring and stupid as this one you are left with a lot of time to think. That's not a good thing in this case. I was very disappointed with this edition to the series and I think a lot of other people will be too. A very big let down.",5.0,22 October 2018
Release the Beast in 2018.,I want to first start off with saying that I'm a huge fan of the Purge series as a whole. I own and have seen all of the films with Anarchy being my personal favorite. I will now start the review. I enjoyed this prequel quite a bit. I would say it's my second favorite in the series. I don't know what is up with all of the negative reviews from critics and users alike saying it's filled with propaganda and racism. Wake Up what is this your first Purge movie?!?! The first two films had an underlying tone of it and the third went full force with the radical racism. Anyways the story is about the first Purge ever which takes place in Staten Island after the economy crashes and a new form of Government takes a hold over the democratic and republican parties and comes up with this Grand Idea. The acting is decent nothing to write home about though Y'lan Noel as Dmitri was the highlight. The action was great though a tad slower to the uptake compared to the second and third films in the series but that is understandable with the plot. The movie is what it's which is mindless B-Movie Fun and if you wanna read into it and berate it for what it insinuates then that is all you. The franchise makes money just like the Paranormal series and so many others so there is a demographic that enjoys these movies a ton.

Pretty much the same as the other Purge films,"I'm a fan of the Purge films or perhaps the concept of the films. The first Purge film was a home invasion movie, Purge Anarchy was more like Mad Max/Action, and Purge Election Year was more of the same. Each Purge film brings in some interesting subtext on some extreme views of how America has become a festering breeding ground for violence. Each film starts off roughly the same. There's an interesting backstory, then the purge begins and then all subtext / ideas / ideology disappears and is surrounded by violence and action.

I still like these films as they're entertaining but there is a lot to be desired. The First Purge takes you into the countries current divide and how an uprising of a new governmental party has rose from the countries divide of the Republicans / Democrats (this was literally told in a montage in the first minute). From there, there was a participatory government experiment on having the purge. The film felt more like the disenfranchised black experience of the purge and explored what Purge Anarchy discussed.

The movie is entertaining but a bit ridiculous towards the end. There's a Purge TV show which seems like the right direction for the franchise.",5.0,30 July 2018
Purge it,"A low-budget cash-in attempt on the successful ""Purge"" franchise. Violence and gore never get old, does it? But without style and sleaze, they are boring. And this movie has none. Acting is as bad as it can get. Why a fine actress like Tomei accepted this film, I don't know. Screenplay is unimaginative and hollow throughout. Humor pops up unceremoniously in the most unexpected moments and is irritating. Shooting and stabbing are somewhat satisfying. Thankfully, the editor realized he had crap on his hands and dutifully cut most scenes to size to make the predictable plot move along quickly. This movie evokes black+white racial tensions in its narrative where blacks are portrayed as victims-even murderers and gangsters-and whites as nasty predators, like Nazis. Some people are not gonna like it, others are gonna love it. I don't care. I just wanted to see a good movie, which I didn't. I was seriously considering switching to some other content on Netflix, but last act of the movie turned out to be somewhat tighter in pace and content than the rest and therefore, I decided to stick right till the end. While, this film is not the worst I've seen, there is nothing to see here really. You would be better off watching something or anything else.",4.0,10 August 2020
Gotta turn off your brain for this one.,"If you really want something with a plotline that you can enjoy, this really isn't it. There are lots of semi-cool action and chaos scenes, which is pretty normal for a Purge movie. But there just isn't any believable backstory or logic to this one.

This is basically an 80's flick in 2018, lots of over-the-top guns and explosions, some weird slow-mo gun-foo moments. Semi-decent acting, and a ridiculous plotline. If you really want a good shooter movie you would be much better off with any number of war movies or cop movies.

My main overall complaint is that this film just feels shallow. There are some sorta-scary and interesting moments at the beginning. But then it just turns into a giant, unbelievable shoot-out in the last quarter of the movie, the finale is hilariously bad.",4.0,20 September 2018
could of been better,"Had everything to make this an epic Purge movie but unfortunately this did not make the grade, I'm a big fan of the Purge franchise and have had many conversations with people on how I'd like to see it go and what should happen, for me The Purge was really good, The Purge: Anarchy was excellent, The Purge: Election Year was good but this new one just didn't live up to my expectations.

The story is OK with some good action and some cool kills but it has lost its Purge DNA and ended up like an bad 80's action movie that's trying to be a across between The Raid, Malcolm X and Die Hard.

I'd of much preferred to see some raw random purging from from average Joe Blogs that's had enough with he's day to day life or John from round the corner that's sick of he's boss all linked by a news crew or someone that wakes up from a night partying.

Gruesome Action in a Psychological Thriller.,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who are squeamish with lots of gutting, throat slitting, or gun violence, because there's lots of it. Main character is courageous and brutal, but still finds a way to be likeable to the audience. As someone who likes Blumhouse movies, this is nothing different. These movies are low budget for a reason, so even if the blood not looking so real doesn't throw me off, because you just have to believe it's real. That's how these movies work.

Not as good as the others,"The First Purge is a prequel to the franchise showing us how the annual event started. Usually whenever these films get political they are never as clever as they think they are. The First Purge is no exception as it repeats the same old political satirical style we've already seen in the previous films and it's even goofier. With lines like ""pussy grabber"" it's clearly aimed at today's Trump era and it's just played for cheap laughs.

The set-up is slow and meaningless because we already know what will happen and they spend a good twenty minutes building up the story and trying to create tension. The main villain is just a political figure in a suit who gives out stupid speeches about cleaning up society and we've seen it plenty of times before.

We never feel a connection to these one dimensional characters as a lot of them are annoying clichéd stereotypes. There are some okay scenes that look good and it's unpredictable sometimes in the way it just kills off characters. But in the end it's just repeats the things from the previous films in a way where it feels tedious. Beware because there is a TV spin-off coming soon.",5.0,20 October 2018

Outside world politics should not have a place in films unless it is to further the plot and add to it, whereas in this movie all it did was take me out of the viewing experience and dropped me into the middle of the 2016 election. Regarding the rest of the movie, it started off ""OK"" but it veered into a different direction after the first 30-40 minutes and started going downhill. I was left in my seat watching people kill each other with knifes and guns in the most bland way I have seen.

A franchise that succumbs without a taste of its own medicine: purgation,"With all the odds in its favor, Blumhouse has released its would-be summer hit in the form of a prequel of James DeMonaco's successful utopia - at least in box-office terms, - aiming at big dividends, mainly, in American cinemas. If this is true, then it'd surely mean the elongation of this overwhelmingly worn premise for a couple of more years on the big screen, not counting USA Network's TV series. ""The First Purge,"" an origin film about the birth of the controversial law that has grossed almost USD$ 320 million since 2013, is, by far, one of the most generic, tasteless and violent movies of the company since, paradoxically, the highly ambitious second installment of this same franchise starring Carmen Ejogo and Frank Grillo.

In the eyes of audiences, the first ""The Purge"" was a true-blue phenomenon when it hit theatres because of its edgy, potential background, however, its true achievement was to be one of the founding productions of the magic formula that defines Jason Blum's studio: tight budgets, novel directors, juicy stories, generally, are equal to great films. With DeMonaco at the helm from the very first moment, it could well be attributed to him all the success, but also all the failures from an idea that has been slaughtered mercilessly. In times where overpopulation, war, racism, poverty and depletion of natural resources are problems grabbing headlines day after day, it's attractive, and at some point twisted, to turn and see a cinematographic fiction that raises as a ""mediating"" solution a 12-hour period in which everybody is absolved of legal consequences, all criminal activity is allowed, of course, among them, murder. After the screening, a feeling of dissatisfaction arises in the viewer in response to the decision of the film of embracing modern horror tropes and conventionalities and isolating of a context pulpy in commentaries.

The 2013 film used such a violent and controversial premise as a backdrop to build a torpid home-invasion, of course, set up in the typical white, well-off, dysfunctional family's high-tech home. The 2014 sequel was a survival thriller using the interesting core idea mainly as an axis to unfold and push the mundane plot, but also, to a lesser degree, to take their first and shaky steps towards appraisals on elite dominance. Some years later, the third entry came in with multiple advantages, including the ideal setting (American presidential elections) and the perfect release date (Independence Day in the States) both to expose a story to analyze, to criticize and, at least, to talk about the intriguing premise of a no-law America in order to make back its low budget just in its opening weekend, unfortunately, DeMonaco moved in the wrong direction, creating another obviously higher-budget survival thriller, keeping alive his tendency to project pictures with chances for iconicity, keeping alive his tendency to waste the possibilities of a dying franchise that, with a better script and execution, could have been the first award-worthy movie of the studio, long before Jordan Peele's visceral horror denunciation.

It was not so, however, motivated by the great numbers of ""The Election Year"" two years ago, the 10-year production Universal-Blumhouse deal started up as soon as possible a movie to ""close"" this agonizing circle. Will loyal audiences turn away from the very first film to be starred almost entirely by African American actors? Will they finally deal the final blow to knock down the misdirected, greedy hopes of these two studies to keep on lining their pockets at the expense of cinematographically offensive offerings? Let's see it.

""The First Purge"" is probably the first and unique of the entire franchise that has a really considerable social-commentary dose, still and all its thick-headedness and inefficiency, since if it is compared with its predecessors/successors, Gerard McMurray strives to say something- via bestial, outrageous scenes that find a solution in controversial violence -about caustic inequality, race snobbery, political manipulation and bigotry, all clumsily enclosed in a political bubble that, strangely, never bursts. In his two films, McMurray's always managed to acquire perspectives stirring self-assessment and social feedback, but just as his Netflix grim drama debut ""Burning Sands,"" he comes unstuck overcoming the rulebook of the genre in which his stories are contained to deliver better stuff than many other directors have tried to deliver, especially the black filmmakers.

DeMonaco taking a back seat in favor of a ""new"" voice brings on drastic changes into the narrative and visual field; a moderately healthy decision. Although he doesn't enrich the mythos, neither fortifies its origins, he delivers a balanced approach in content but unbalanced in quality, put another way, crafting terrifying pictures takes second place in order to raise an unsatisfactory plotting deepening; unfortunately, neither of the two fields gets truly good treatment. On this occasion, the film doesn't know what it is, a ""Get-Out""-ish social freak out or an unsurprising survival thriller, a dilemma drowned, as usual, by a range of ear-shattering stings. This movie is a shame, bearing in mind that the last hopes were put on this undecided prequel; apparently, one more franchise with wasted chances to transcend its entertainment barriers.

From the beginning, this entry fought against one of the most heavy-going obstacles to this-day popular universe-expanding prequels: We already know the end of the story. For this reason, the script, penned by DeMonaco, should defend itself with a standalone-yet-interesting story, tough enough to keep stand from the very first scenes, one nourished by nerve-shatteringly tense sequences, with plot devices developing and evolving the narration altogether, a story with clever, human characters getting rid of hackneyed races against time. Small wonder that it doesn't come out victorious from this requirement. The characters, far from throwing away modern action film stereotypes, are easy preys to meaningless, cat's paws running around and butchering to preserve their lives. Fortunately, unlike the thousands of mindless horror offerings out there, here the relationships between the characters involve a sense of humanity, which automatically causes that, at some point in the film, we worry about the fate of these fictitious individuals.

Peculiarly, antagonistic weight doesn't fall on a fixed actor, rather strongly belongs to wicked government intervention distorting the already nefarious experiment. This is one of its few strong suits, however, much like characters, the shallowness of this ""villain"" doesn't even try to fight audience's predictions, falling into ""race against the clock"" field over and over again, a lost race.

Y'lan Noel plays the tritely cold-blooded gangster/action hero in a good way, with a strange charm that ends up echoing among the audience. Unfortunately, Dimitri, his character, is portrayed as a violent, vengeful man, two adjectives that clash with the notion of savior in this kind of film. Lex Scott Davis is who delivers the best performance, even if her character is nothing but another indomitable girl; alright, she gets a special plotting push, but, in the end, is one more final girl saved by a super-man. Mugga, the usual Afro-American comedy-horror comic-relief, does quite well her work, is a positive addition to the melodrama that bathes part of the story.

I'm absolutely confident that this film will be remembered for two huge disasters: one, R.I.P. promising premise; two, an unfairly wasted Marisa Tomei. They've muted Tomei's character and that's an unforgivable mistake. In the first two acts, the creative mind behind this ""social catharsis"" doesn't say more than six lines - the first one, in front of an egregious green screen -and as soon as the third act kicks off, a certain ""twist"" takes place and destroys everything. Marvel's new Aunt May could have been a dream villain, clearly, with a worthy-of-respect design and treatment; alas, it was the greatest sin of a ramshackle tragedy.

""The First Purge"" by Gerard McMurray is just another run-of-the-mill thriller; a rushed B-movie throwback that doesn't even set up DeMonaco's gloomy, eye-catching visual spectacle. But, at the very least, it does achieve to deliver an obtuse edge of complexity to a premise that was on its last legs, burying a meaty context that hardly will resurface, at least, with brand-new stuff. After an insufferably lengthy period of almost seven hours - the four films' runtime belonging to this franchise, - something has happened: the experiment has expired. Mixing together DeMonaco's ever-aggressive pulp imagery and McMurray's improvement of some storytelling purposes, a perversely violent-yet-juicy cinematic cocktail may have come out from all this madness, unfortunately, said utopia will never be a reality; the experiment is over.",4.0,31 October 2018

Acting: Not that bad, incredibly cringy with the scarred psycho character and with all the ""hood talk"" but other than that it was decent.

Cinematography: Great set design and shots as always in these purge movies, they're really creative.

Story: Here's where it gets bad. The story is too boring and mundane, its just about a brother, sister and a gang member surviving ""the purge"". With little to no characterization and feeling into the characters. It feels like they will get through any situation and even if they dont why would we care. The previous purges where emmensly more creative and enduring.

I was hoping for a lot more,"I've never seen any of the other Purge movies, but I was attracted by the idea of a prequel that showed the beginnings of a dystopian world. Maybe a cool and complex conspiracy like V for Vendetta. That got flushed in the first few minutes because that's how long it took to cover it - in summary, something happened and now the country condones penalty free crime with an extremely thin explanation. Very disappointing.

I'm a political moderate, but the political messaging was really over the top. It was kind of like watching a hard left version of Hannity, and just as pointless. And it kept going on. Repeatedly. Over and over again. Many times. I think you get the point.

The villains were extremely two dimensional and completely uninteresting. What little writing talent was devoted to the protagonists, and this was a rare good point about the movie. There's some complexity there, with people you can root for. I liked them.

It was fairly suspenseful, but there were too many coincidental ""just in time"" saves for no good reason. This seemed to be just lazy writing. There is a semi-interesting conspiracy but the effect just didn't seem realistic. There's a good amount of well done violent action so if that's something of interest this might be a good movie for you.

One day after I got off work and was waiting to pick my brother up from the train station, I had a few hours to kill, so I used my MoviePass to kill some time while watching ""The First Purge"". It was super boring and not very fun to watch. The characters sucked and it wasn't anything new from what has been done already.

Disappointing,"Okay, I know, it's number four, so, what should I expect. But Resident Evil churned out six or more films and the sequels managed to maintain their quality, so, I thought the latest Purge might hold up. While the original Purge was a clever, inventive low-budget indie that was well done, had tension and thrills, this latest Purge is a mediocre to bad B-movie, which, considering the much larger budget on this film...is rather disappointing. Usually more money means more freedom to do more. I have to give my hat to the first film which made something really interesting and original on...I think it was 3 million. That's nothing. I'm not sure why after letting the creating over The Purge write and direct the first 3 films did they hand The First Purge to a director with almost no experience. It shows. Like, a lot. I remember reading that the director took the script and made a lot of edits to it. That shows to.

Within the first 5-10 minutes it's pretty bad. I was going to shut it off because I did not have high hopes but wanted to give it a chance so watched the whole thing. Not the worst thing I've ever seen but just not good. Zero tension, zero scares. It would have been interesting to have some mystery to it, instead the first 20 minutes the actors explain to you everything that is happening. Basically, the first 20 minutes are exposition. That is terrible. Usually in a movie a character appears for a couple lines to explain what is going on and let the audience figure out the rest. This movie literally talks you through it. That's aside from the fact that within the first 5 minutes I was like, this would never happen. There's no way some new political party gets elected and they just allow them to experiment on a town and film it. Like, do they understand how politics even work or how much actual power they have? Clearly not. The original film is effective in making you suspend belief that a purge would ever happen, and leaves you thinking. The First Purge is just so utterly unrealistic and at certain points ridiculous.

It was rife with cliches, the cinematography was terrible, a lot of the acting is bad, directing bad, camera work bad, writing bad. The only thing it had going for it was a few of the Purgers had interesting masks. There is even one scene where I think the director didn't get his shot so he blacked out the film for a couple seconds then jumped to another moment. I think he was trying to make it look like it was an effect but it just looked like part of the film was missing.

The whole thing, drug dealer with a heart of gold was pretty lame. One minute he's a ruthless sociopath and the next he has a sensitive side. Lame. Then he just happens to have ninja skills along with extreme special forces skills and manages to go all Rambo and kill about 50 highly trained mercenaries. Not forgetting to mention the drug dealer also has a stash of weapons in a hideout that makes him look like James Bond. Super realistic. If the dude is this skilled and has a $120,000 car, a super soldier hideout, what is he doing living in the projects? Makes no sense. And what is he doing being a drug dealer? If he's that skilled I'm pretty sure he could find better work.

It could have been cool but just wasn't. Oh, and the psychologist who created the whole experiment halfway through the movie starts talking about how the other dude is unethical and how she's going to expose him. Really? Like, what she's doing isn't bad 'cause it's for scientific study? Just ridiculous. And the mask they use on the poster is not even a Purger, it's just some extra at a block party who has no role in the film whatsoever. Total false advertising.

I would say if it is on Netflix or cable and you don't have to spend money watching this and you feel compelled, go for it, but set your expectations really low. I wouldn't even say it was entertaining. So many other better movies to watch. Happy Death Day and Truth or Dare were much better as far as new Blum House films. Of course, Get Out.

I found the movie to be extremely politically and racially charged. It was as offensively divided as it could possibly be. Also,,, the 'hero' of the movie was a drug dealer?!? How is that ever okay?!? Yeah, he may be taking care of his neighborhood, but at what cost?!?

A far cry from the previous Purge films,,,",4.0,15 May 2020
Not worse nor better,"The first Purge is not as bad as most reviewers rated it. It's just another purge, how it all started as an experiment on a limited scale.

intro purge,"Despite its low rating, it is the best of the series so far. It is coherent. It has thrilling moments (Joivan Wade style), street Purge originality, a social issue subplot, good humour (from Dolores), and a quirky experiment.Something in the series doesn't add up-if you eliminate the poor, who will do the blue collar jobs.Eliminating the sick on the other hand was tried by nazis.",4.0,18 October 2018
"Haters gonna hate, the purge will not be purged","All the 1 star haters here prompted my 10 star, id really rate it a 6/7. A fun movie, the most 'realistic' movie of all the purge movies. Acting was above average, action scenes were intense and fun.",10.0,23 September 2018

From the opening credits to the ending, I was at the edge of my seat and couldn't believe I was watching a movie that had so much depth and soul. The First Purge is an amazing film which depicts a realistic view in some circles of society today. I was deeply moved and had to go buy three more tickets for the next screening. I am going to watch this movie again and again until the IMDB rating gets to at least the 13 Days 4.5. Go see this movie and rate it high, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,7 July 2018
Harsh,These reviews are a little harsh. If you like the other three Purge movies then this one shouldn't be any different. I felt like it was logical and if this were to happen it would indeed happen the way it did in the movie. If your huge into the other ones this one is great and as a whole it is a good franchise. I'd say it's worth the watch if you love horror. However if your sensitive then I'd skip it because it is for sure a tad raciest. Intentional I'm not sure but I looked past it.,8.0,17 July 2018

Best of the purge movies...HANDS DOWN!,"I don't understand why this movie has so many poor ratings. The movie was very honest. Think about lynchings that took place in the past. Whites would come from neighboring counties to join in and to kill innocent people. Many of the negative reviews will come from whites and not minorities, because this movies holds a mirror of their ancestors transgressions in front of them. Transgressions that they still today benefit from. Another reason why some might not like the movie, is that it shows who Blacks really are. Yes they do things day to day that are not perfect, but if there is no need to harm, they don't. Which is why there was very little participation by the minorities. Also, when it was needed, they stuck together and took care of one another. Compare the way that they minorities responded to the purge in this movie, to the way that whites responded to it in all of the other movies. BIG DIFFERENCE! LAST: A Black man who is a Drug dealer becoming the hero? IT. WAS. AWESOME!!! Whether you're white or a minority, just watch the movie, as a movie. Try not to think rave or politics.

I seriously would ignore the bad reviews that you see. They have to be from a bunch of haters.

Possibly the best Purge ...,"There's a long buildup to the action in this Purge, and while I appreciate that there where numerous details that had to be conveyed so we could all understand all the internal and external factors at play, I still thought that with a little more adroit creativity this time could have been shortened. However, it is worth it. Once the action starts there's no getting off the freight-train of drama, tension and action until the very end. A little more originality to the back stories of the principle characters would have improved the movie overall to my mind (they were a little cliche), but there's no getting away from the irresistible scary masks, the diabolical psychopaths and the evolution of heroes that emerge, all portrayed by a very large, capable and enigmatic cast. A very complicated sequence to direct, film and edit obviously, but here the filmmakers have risen to the challenge to produce one of the most exciting and satisfying Purge movies I've ever seen.

Misunderstood,"Is not so scary or violent (compering it with the other movies) but it makes a lot of sense to the full story and does not go into controversies (regarding the general plot of The Purge franchise). It meets the objective of showing how the political party ""NFFA"" emerges and the idea of the experiment.

I think most of the dislikes are because the actual tensions between political ideas in the U.S. (and in the world), plus racial conflicts. All these are based on real things, though. And not all the ""bad guys"" are white like some of the other comments/reviews say. Many other black characters try to kill the protagonists. And you have to remember that the NFFA use many disguises like the KKK or other supremacist groups to hunt down people in the movie. ""You've made your bed, now lie in it"".

I feel satisfied with the movie taking in consideration that the new TV series is out with a new episode each week. And we have more Purge stuff to watch, not only this movie.",9.0,6 October 2018
"A short review of ""The First Purge"" (2018)","""The First Purge"" (2018) isn't the best horror-thriller I've ever seen, but it certainly isn't the worst, either. I thought that I would be all purged out by now, but this fourth entry in the film series is a solid prequel - I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. (There is also a TV show set in ""The Purge"" universe, which USA has renewed for a second season, and I'm told that it's pretty good.) I suppose this is a durable franchise because its premise could be explored through countless different characters.

The movie has some weaknesses. The pacing is off, and you could argue that the political theme of ""The Purge"" films, though compelling, is getting redundant by now. (There are some specific jabs this time out at Donald Trump and his following; they're heavy-handed, but they're fun to spot.)

But ""The First Purge"" is still a suspenseful and disturbing dystopian horror film. It's got a terrific bad guy in Rotimi Paul's ""Skeletor"" psychopath and some surprisingly damned good action sequences. There is another difference here, too - this ""Purge"" is far less campy than the second and third films. There are fewer plot twists, fewer over-the-top characters, and far fewer trippy visuals - it feels more like a straight horror film instead of a zany one. Depending on your preferences, you might find it superior.

One more thing - given its obvious love for Staten Island, this film would make a great double-feature with ""Bushwick"" (2017), another thriller which seems like a love letter to its own setting in Brooklyn. And they are both urban neighborhood thrillers with a similar storytelling style.",8.0,9 February 2019

A Great Prequel,"I liked the first Purge movie so I was excited to watch this one. I'm glad I did because I ended up being way more invested in this one than the first. Not only did they create a movie that reflects society and gives us possible what ifs, they also gave us an entertaining movie that makes us think.

Our heroes are flawed but likable and even admirable at times. There's nothing like having a hero you can root for. And the villains come in many forms: the government, the people who chose to commit crimes during the purge, and even that one crazy guy that should DEFINITELY be avoided.

Overall, yes, this Purge movie throws in some politics but it's actually kinda realistic and is very applicable to how this society is.",10.0,14 March 2019

Once the purge starts in all of the films, it's all about survival and the thrilling intensity of such. I really enjoyed this and the ""hero"" of the film.

I didnt really like the spinoff series as these kind of stories are much better in a couple hour sessions.

The quality is still there,"This first purge shows the political basis that the third franchise evoked frontally with its drifts. This is not a surprise and it is the main flaw of this fourth franchise, which is chronologically situated before the first one. In order to curb unemployment and the abundance of poor people, a party that wins the US elections (extremely religious, advocating a return to the founding fathers) tests a night of purge on a New York neighborhood: murder is accepted and tolerated for one night only, with people encouraged to take out their anger. The party in power tests this to see how it works and whether it should be generalized to the whole country.

This framework is mixed with a war between drug dealers and a group that tries to help poor people. Definitely, this franchise maintains its level over time. This movie is like every movie in the franchise: a clever mix of horror, action and chase, with a very strong (and maybe not so subtle) political and social background. It works perfectly.

It's been a long time since we've seen Marisa Tomei. And the whole cast is perfect: Lex Scott Davi and Y'lan Noel are very good, as is Joivan Wade. Great cast.",8.0,25 April 2022
The Most Memorable Purge,,8.0,7 September 2022
A Political Purge,"The Purge franchise has always been a lot more about an excuse for senseless action, and less about social commentary. Well, every franchise has a prequel in them, and The Purge is no different. However, for whatever reason, this version mixed a thick layer of political commentary into the action.

The plot is that with America falling into ruin, the government tries to kill undesirables such as lower income minorities to solve crime and unemployment. What would happen if they could all go and kill themselves without penalty? Remind us of anything in current politics? It is not subtle or creative, but I don't mind my action movies trying to have a message.

There is a collection of totally unoriginal and forgettable characters that serve their roles, and as the action unfolds, there is nothing particularly poor about the film. If you are watching a Purge film, you are going to get what you want out of it. Unfortunately, as the 'twist' plays out, the film becomes Rambo with all the subtlety of a very loud bomb. But whatever, I know what I sat down to watch was not going to be getting any Oscar nods.

That neither makes or breaks the film. This film is however' very low budget, and they must have spent most of that on the Marisa Tomei (speaking of Oscars) cameo used in the trailer. The action is acceptable, but very average, and the sets and scenes feel cheap.

The ending is not satisfying, and abandons itself. I think I wanted the film to be over as much as the director at this point.

As the fourth installment of a pretty flawed franchise, it isn't horrible. But, it sure ain't great either.

The verdict is a very generous 6\10",,20 September 2018
"Thing IS, unfortunately, the film makers know their market.","I totally agree with everyone here, the First Purge is awful, biased, racist, everything they say about it. The sad thing IS, that judging by the amounts of money mentioned on IMDB it's done very well. $13,000,000 to make, over $40,000,000 domestically and much, much more than that worldwide (he says, not being able to remember the exact figure!) Can't see it from this review page but I think it was over $100,000,000!!! So they knew their market and made a lot of money out of it.

Which is sad. And says a lot more about those who went to see it than about the film makers who, after all, just made the movie FOR them to see. It shows how many racist, supremacist idiots there are around, willing to pay many bucks a ticket for something that fits their own twisted thinking.

As long as there's people like that around, there'll be movies made to milk them. Did I go to see it? Nope - I saw enough clips online to know it wasn't a movie I'd ever be interested in seeing and I love a good horror flick.

If I'd been on that island, I'd've just taken a sack of food and a pile of books, holed up underground somewheres for the night and come out when all was over to get my 5 grand! (Maybe a smart phone as well to let me know what was going on, if that wasn't allowed or something remember I've not seen the whole movie.)

Nasty little movie dressed up as a horror. And that's from someone who doesn't think ANY of the Saw movies went downhill, loved 'em all!! (Guilty pleasure? Human Centipede 2!!)

Purge....need I say more,"I have never watched these films before as the overriding ""suburban snuff"" theme has never appealed to me.

In a misguided fit of boredom I took a look at The First Purge and I can assure you it will be the last. This is by far and away, one of the trashiest, pointlessly violent, films I have encountered.

Worse still, the characterisations are trite, superficial and mostly monosyllabic. Its a bad mix that adds to the overriding sense of brutish idiocy, that this proposition represents.

I believe this drivel has been made into a television series? Personally I can't think of one good reason why. 0/10 from me.",,20 September 2018
