    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t really have any complaints about the movie, I really enjoyed it evenly throughout. Decent plot, good acting and a great consistency in quality, which I really appreciated. It&apos;s not perfect by any means, but it is worth to give it a watch in my opinion. For a movie that lasts 2 and a half hours I&apos;ve got to say I never actually got bored, which is another good thing this movie has. Although I would say that there isn&apos;t anything THAT notable in the movie that makes it stand out, hence the 8 stars. Other than that it is pretty great, and nothing else to really point out. I would recommend it if you have the time. It&apos;s a pretty nice, action-packed film that retains its quality evenly throughout.",
