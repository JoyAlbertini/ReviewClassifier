Do you have it in you to make it epic?,"George Miller... ""Why yes, yes I do. Well sort of anyway...""

I really really wanted to love Furiosa but in the end I didn't, I liked it but didn't love it. Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.

The good news: You want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?

Casting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe's followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he's not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.

And there's world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.

The bad news: Visually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn't. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... 'eww, yikes' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.

The music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.

The writing and edit isn't great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.

In the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many 'that was close' nor 'that was amazing' moments.

Overall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I'd be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.

By my deeds I honour him...

By my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa. Its worth your time and money but not more than that.",7.0,23 May 2024
"Good start, ending could have been better","Pretty good movie. Enough action and with enough speed for the most part. Fun to see the three major settlements back from the 2015 mad max saga.

In the begin I did worry a little bit about the green screen effect what I did notice but that feeling faded away over time.

There is however one big negative and that was the last 20/30minutes. Slow paced, little bit boring and dragged on.. I was kinda waiting for the movie to just end. Its a shame because it makes you leave the theaters with a bad taste for a pretty good movie.

Actors were decent, script decent, action decent, green screen decent (but could been better), story line decent (except ending).

All by all 7out of 10.",7.0,23 May 2024
15 years of Wasteland,"It would be folly to try and outdo Fury Road and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is smart enough to not even attempt that. It's a completely different film in its structure which allows it to be a prequel that tells a complete story on its own whilst still enhancing Fury Road with its world building. The fact that George Miller is still telling stories in the wasteland at this scale is a real gift.

Alyla Brown gets a lot more screen time than child versions of pre-established characters usually get and with next to no dialogue she is superb at communicating everything without words. Carrying that on for the second half, Anya Taylor-Joy does a phenomenal job and was right to fight to keep the scream in. If you need someone to act exclusively with their eyes, she is as perfect as they come.

Chris Hemsworth is clearly relishing the opportunity to play a properly mad villain with Dementus and has so many chill inducing moments. This is easily the best he's been so far, completely unhinged with just enough depth to explain everything he does. He's a complicated figure who always seeks power but is never able to truly hold onto it.

George Miller truly is a genius when it comes to exploring this franchise. Getting to see a fully realised Gas Town and Bullet Farm allows this world to cohere like never before and the action crafted here is so epic with gorgeous imagery that refuses to slow down. Just like John Seale achieved last time, Simon Duggans's cinematography can keep the action clean no matter what's thrown at it.

It makes sense that the only way Tom Holkenborg could come close to his best work on Fury Road was to return to the wasteland and his score here continues to compliment the kineticism of the action so well. The only downside is the CGI which looks pretty bad at various points and stands out further because of how well Fury Road implemented it.",9.0,25 May 2024

It was great!,"I just finished watching the movie premiere here in my country and i was soooo satisfied!

Let me start with the beginning: The little girl who plays Furiosa did an amazing job even if her dialogue was minimum! She was great! Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny, scary and...demented! This role of a villain was great for him and much much better than the last Thor interpretations!

Anya Taylor-Joy was, from my perspective, a much better Furiosa than Charlize Theron! She did an amazing job!

The CGI was there but it was top notch and the ones who complained about the use of CGI doesn't understand a movie like this needs some CGI!

The vehicles, motorbikes were steampunk constructed and cool! Dementus truck was a BEAST!!! The roaring of the engine was beyond cool! It was amaaaaazing! The young Immortan Joe was decent, his boys are there(from Mad Max: Fury Road) .

Some little brutality, little humor that worked like a jewel!

A little minor Spoiler: i think there was a little, very little scene of Max filmed from behind..there was his car as well. The verdict: A must seen, a must seen in theater for the best feeling! The sound of motorbikes and that beast, the Dementus truck motor engine sound was so cool!!! 9/10 from me!",9.0,22 May 2024
This is what action is....,"I feel many go into Furiosa expecting a Mad max movie, and at its core it is so much different. With its predecessor being Fury road, Furiosa had a very high bar to achieve. However, these 2 movies are so different, while they may seem similar they are completely different action movies. Furiosa takes on a much more different aesthetic with the use of slightly more darker and less vibrant colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story. The use of cgi is pretty disappointing, if you have a keen eye you can pretty easily the digital doubles and green screen. Anya Taylor-Joy gives an absolutely amazing performance. Dare I say she is better than Charlize Theron in Fury Road? Absolutely! Chris Hemsworth was also great and hilarious. Furiosa, while it may have many flaws, is one of the best action movies to come out in recent times, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. Furiosa is in no ways perfect, but do I love it? Yes.",9.0,25 May 2024
"Furiosa is an absolute thrill ride, with jaw-dropping action, a kickass female lead, and visuals that will leave you breathless!","From start to finish, Furiosa is filled with heart-pounding action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and a captivating storyline. Anya Taylor's performance as Furiosa is nothing short of incredible, showcasing her strength, determination, and vulnerability. The film's post-apocalyptic setting is brought to life with stunning cinematography and jaw-dropping practical effects.

The intense chase scenes and thrilling battles will keep you on the edge of your seat. Furiosa is a modern action classic that deserves all the praise it has received. Don't miss out on this epic adventure!

You should see this one the biggest screen possible!",9.0,22 May 2024
Good recipe with subpar ingredients,"Furiosa would be easier to watch if Fury Road never happened. After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.

Only thing I found charming was the overall 80's feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or ""poignant"" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I'm watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.

Speaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.

But the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult. Relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is so robotic and unemotional it's painful to watch. Dementus's monologue at the end was a snoozefest. All in all, I witnessed it, and found it mediocre.",6.0,23 May 2024
Very good storyline,"""Furiosa"" is an exhilarating addition to the Mad Max franchise that masterfully blends intense action, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals. Director George Miller returns with his signature style, delivering a prequel that not only lives up to the high standards set by ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" but also expands the lore in fascinating ways.

Anya Taylor-Joy shines in the titular role, bringing both ferocity and depth to Furiosa's character. Her performance is nuanced, capturing the raw survival instinct and emotional complexity of a young woman navigating a brutal, post-apocalyptic world. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances that add layers to the narrative and enrich the overall experience.

The film's action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. Miller's direction ensures that every chase, fight, and explosion is not only thrilling but also coherent and impactful. The practical effects and stunts are awe-inspiring, creating a visceral experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Visually, ""Furiosa"" is a masterpiece. The cinematography and production design transport viewers to a desolate yet strangely beautiful wasteland, where every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience fully. The score, too, complements the film perfectly, enhancing the tension and emotional beats with its powerful compositions.

Beyond the action, ""Furiosa"" offers a compelling story of resilience, rebellion, and redemption. It delves into the origins of one of the franchise's most iconic characters, providing a rich backstory that fans will find deeply satisfying. The film balances its high-octane sequences with moments of genuine character development and emotional resonance.

Overall, ""Furiosa"" is a triumphant return to the world of Mad Max. It's a must-watch for fans of the series and a standout action film in its own right, combining breathtaking action, strong performances, and a gripping narrative to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.",9.0,25 May 2024
MEDIOCRE!,"Max Mad fan here, I would rate previous movies: Mad Max around a 6, Road Warrior 8 Thunder Dome 7 Fury Road 9 and speaking of Fury Road....

This is unfortunately a pale comparison to Fury Road. The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.

It's sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It's also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.

The story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this. The world building is cool though and you get more of the cool world of Mad Max so that is a big plus.

Actors do a decent to a good job all around.

Immortan Joe is not impressed.

MEDIOCRE!!!",6.0,22 May 2024
"It's not a 10, but great movie!","When I say breaking bad, LOTR is a 10, and I give this a 8, thats an amazing score and compliment.

I thought there was no way this movie was gonna beat fury road, but wow i was surprised. I cannot tell you what it lacked, because I truly feel like this movie was so well rounded, and diligently executed. It had action, script, well playing actors, drama, cinematography and music!!

This is what you come to the cinema for, how lucky are we to have watched to extremely good movie this year already ( dune 2 ). I could be talked in to watching this a second time for sure.

Oh god I love good movies!",9.0,19 May 2024
A Disappointing Experience in Every Aspect,"A weak repeat of its original version that is extremely boring, devoid of content, and even lacks the appeal of real action. I prefer to watch the 2015 version and enjoy it instead of watching this film. The performances are extremely weak and unconvincing, making it impossible for you to sympathize with them. The lack of contrast and ups and downs in the film prevents you from getting engaged and understanding it. Even the director fails to create the suspense he aims to instill in you. In terms of special effects and sound quality, if I were to compare it with the film ""Dune II"" that I watched on the same IMAX screen two months ago, I must say it was really unsuccessful in this area. The sounds not only failed to shock you but also created noise.",6.0,23 May 2024
A missed opportunity.,"While Fury Road boasted impressive stunts and action set pieces, Furiosa unfortunately over-relies on poor CGI and green screen for all its action scenes, completely detaching viewers from any sense of immersion.

With the recent movie The Fall Guy feeling like a love letter to stunts and filmmaking, Furiosa felt like the exact opposite.

Although the movie successfully conveys the themes it aims to explore, it falls flat narratively due to its incredible repetitiveness and predictability. The action lacked excitement and thrill, leaving much to be desired after watching.

Junkie XL delivers an uninspired soundtrack, with all the songs sounding similar to ones we've heard before. The acting was, however, for the most part great, with Chris Hemsworth standing out as the villain.

Furiosa fails to capture the magic and excitement of its predecessors, relying too heavily on subpar CGI and lacking originality in its narrative, action and soundtrack. Despite its thematic ambitions, the film ultimately feels like a missed opportunity and a step down for the franchise.",5.0,23 May 2024
It was never meant to top Fury Road!,"However does it mean this movie is bad? No!! Fury Road is a masterpiece and it is damn near impossible to come up with something that can surpass it!

This is a movie for the action fans, as there is a TON of that, with some great intensity, spectacle and an overall feeling, that this movie should be experienced at the movies! Trust me, watching it at home is not the same! It needs a big screen!

The story was fine, Anya Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth did great as their respective characters! I was glad to see them do something like this, as I now will remember them for these roles!

Cinematography.. excellent! The effects were great too and I was never too distracted by the CGI, just a little!

If you are looking for a fun time at the movies, this is a safe bet!",8.0,24 May 2024
Different from fury road,"I loved this movie. I didn't love everything about this movie, but I absolutely loved it.

I loved fury road and I loved this one. They are quite different, and I personally enjoyed Furiosa more.

Fury road is like one, long, action-fuelled, fever dream of a music video,where the plot is tertiary. Furiosa is more like a post-apocalyptic western/opera.

The story telling is top notch, the actresses portraying Furiosa are outstanding and Chris Hemsworth is phenomenal.

What really stood out to me was how masterfully the movie was shot and edited. The cinematography is absolutely top-effing-dollar! I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of this movie. I left the cinema feeling euphoric.",10.0,25 May 2024
A Great Expansion of Fury Road,"One of my biggest unpopular movie opinions is that I'm just not that crazy about Mad Max: Fury Road. I admire it as an action vehicle but as a movie overall it just really leaves me wanting. I've thought this for years but it only really got confirmed to me once it rewatched it the day before I finally saw this movie. The fact that this movie was supposed to be so different from Fury Road was quite appealing to me going in since I don't totally gel with that movie and overall I'm amazed by how much I enjoyed it given my somewhat mixed feelings on the predecessor.

I think where this film succeeds for me compared to Fury Road is that it does takes its time more. There's considerably more world building and moments to breathe between the action scenes. In Fury Road this was very much absent by design but I loved the fact that Miller took a different approach here. I really liked the gradually pace this film took and how it fleshed out this surprisingly interesting world. The one thing I can't deny about Fury Road is how incredible the action scenes are and that's no different here. I think the big difference for me is that there's more build up to them and as such I thought there were more stakes going into them. They're long and jaw dropping in scale and it really does give me an urge to finally watch the original films.

The performances and character work are also top notch and I really appreciate the fact that those are things George Miller doesn't skimp on in his action movies. Anya Taylor-Joy is basically perfect as Furiosa and obviously she's going to be compared with Charlize Theron but ultimately I think both of their portrayals compliment each other very well. While her arc does follow a template we've seen before I ultimately thought it worked very well and I was always interested what action she was going to take next. A big credit for that has to go to Chris Hemsworth who is outstanding and this is easily the best performance I've ever seen him give. He's not the deepest villain I've ever seen but's he's very memorable and Hemsworth gives such an entertaining performance that I just always wanted to see more of him on screen. Tom Burke was also great in a role that I thought was surprisingly wholesome but also quite mysterious in all the right ways.

The story itself though is definitely where the film falters the most for me though. It's split up into very distinctive chapters and in many ways I liked that about it but it also hurt the pacing somewhat. It felt as if the film had to keep re-starting with every new chapter and for as jaw dropping as the action scenes are their length became a bit tiring since the story is so bare bones. I also think the actual ending could've been stronger given that it very much leads directly into Fury Road and the transformation of the Furiosa here into the one in that film didn't feel entirety earned to me.

I had no idea what to expect going into Furiosa but I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It feels like such a natural expansion of the world set up by Fury Road and the character work is surprisingly very strong. It definitely has its weaker aspects but as someone who's not the biggest fan of the predecessor I really appreciated how this movie gave me more than I could've possibly expected.",8.0,29 May 2024
FURIOSA is a GOLD PLAQUE of the YEAR with HIGH ON ACTION,"In the desolate yet visually stunning landscape of George Miller's latest masterpiece, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"" the audience is thrust into a maelstrom of high-octane action and profound storytelling. This prequel to the critically acclaimed ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of ""WHAT A LOVELY DAY"" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action. It cannot be lower at all. It delivers the goods with a gold plaque.",10.0,15 May 2024
2.5 hours felt like 4,"If you're expecting a non-stop, fast paced, high octane movie like Fury Road you'll be sadly disappointed with this outing. The first half is slow. Not to say there aren't interesting points but it could have been tightened up instead of dragged out.

The last hour is action packed. Not great but also not terrible.

There's a lot of call backs to Fury Road, almost as if they were going for a nostalgic vibe but that movie is not even 10 years ago yet.

If you didn't know beforehand that Chris Hemsworth was in the movie you wouldn't know it was even him. He's rocking prosthetic nose and teeth and speaks in a high pitched nasal voice.",6.0,24 May 2024
Quite good,"I don't really have any complaints about the movie, I really enjoyed it evenly throughout. Decent plot, good acting and a great consistency in quality, which I really appreciated. It's not perfect by any means, but it is worth to give it a watch in my opinion. For a movie that lasts 2 and a half hours I've got to say I never actually got bored, which is another good thing this movie has. Although I would say that there isn't anything THAT notable in the movie that makes it stand out, hence the 8 stars. Other than that it is pretty great, and nothing else to really point out. I would recommend it if you have the time. It's a pretty nice, action-packed film that retains its quality evenly throughout.",8.0,30 May 2024

Epic Maxless Madness,"One of the great movies.

The use of colour and especially sound in this movie is stunning. If you pay attention you will be completely captivated by the use of the soundtrack alone.

The story is wonderful. It fleshes out the Mad Max universe adding a richness and depth I didnt know I was missing.

Its full of action and story creating an outstanding cinema outcomes.

The acting, particularly the two leads, is first class and the movie is filled to the brim with rich bombastic characters.

This movie wins on absolutely every level and Im calling it early, this is the film of the year, no doubt :)",9.0,23 May 2024
Fun but utterly forgetable subpar sequel,,6.0,26 May 2024
Furious at this Prequel,"Furious at this prequal

Having watched ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" right before watching this, it was easy to notice the drastic decrease in quality. ""Fury Road"" is truly a full throttle action film while ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is boring and nonsensical from the moment it starts. The opening scene shows a young Furiosa being kidnapped and blowing a whistle to call for help. A whole village of people hear the call but literally only two people respond. She is taken away and there are clearly opportunities when she could have been saved but she isn't for the sake of the plot. This kidnapping scene drags on with poor dialogue and lifeless humor. This was just the beginning of what the rest of this film would be.

Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously lousy character. He was supposed to be the villain but takes on more of a comedic role. From the moment he appears on screen he looks like the parody of a villain. He has a prosthetic nose; he's wearing a white sheet for a cape and accessorizes his outfit with a teddy bear chained to his back. So, it was impossible to take him serious at all especially with that distracting nose that felt pointless to say the least. It didn't help that his dialogue was also playful and made this film a nightmare tonally.

The younger versions of Furiosa not played by Anya Taylor-Joy were well acted but took up too much of the run time. Anya Taylor-Joy was okay as Furiosa. However, there are scenes involving her character that didn't make sense like her walking around The Citadel with long hair unnoticed. Or Immortan Joe never noticing she's gone. Not to mention her escape when she loses her arm. Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke) was also just an okay character. I didn't mind his role in the story.

While the visuals were similar to those of ""Fury Road"", the action scenes didn't feel as intense. There were also random points in the film where someone would narrate the story which was a weird direction to tell this story.

Overall, this film was too long. There are too many scenes that are longer than they needed to be. It was boring for most of its runtime and failed to explore things that would have been more interesting. A forgetful prequel.",4.0,25 May 2024
Best Movie in Mad Max Franchise,"I didn't think they could top Fury Road, but they did. I didn't think Taylor-Joy would pull off a young Furiosa after how well Theron played the part. But she did, stellar performance.

The real surprise is Hemsworth. Best performance of his career in my opinion. Didn't think his character as the villain could be played with such depth - he was perfectly cast, and wouldn't be surprised if he gets several best supporting actor nods during award season.

The quality of the acting overall was a surprise, but I expected awesome action sequences, and it didn't disappoint: the War Rig fight scene is just awesome. Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.

Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel. I can't wait to watch it again when it is out on streaming and watch Fury Road immediately after.",10.0,15 May 2024
WHAT A CINEMATOGRAPHY.,"A badass female revenge story with a character who can only trust herself in the game of survival. This film has car chases and biker hordes and flaming death, but almost more impressive are the small moments of beauty that you won't find anywhere else.

Synopsis: Snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers, young Furiosa falls into the hands of a great biker horde led by the warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe. As the two tyrants fight for dominance, Furiosa soon finds herself in a nonstop battle to make her way home.",8.0,22 May 2024
A great film for Mad Max enthusiasts,"George Miller is a genius. That is undoubtedly the most important thing to remember when watching Furiosa.

The way he constructs the world's and characters to fit his imagination is unparalleled. The action set pieces are so incredibly woven in to his story lines that you find it hard to understand how he starts creating a film like this.

I was lucky enough to attend the UK premiere of the film and hearing members of the cast and crew talk so passionately about the process helped me to understand the enormity of creating a project like Furiosa.

Chris Hemsworth steals the show as Dementia, the villainous gang leader, obviously having huge fun in a turn that contrasts so much from his usual turns as the hero of the piece. There are excellent turns from Anya Taylor-Joy, Tom Burke and Alyla Browne as Young Furiosa, helping to create an emotional understanding of how the character becomes so hell-bent on revenge.

At times, there is a complexity that seems unnecessary and becomes slightly frustrating at times when character development is taking precedence over action. In some ways the film is a victim of its own brilliance. Because the action sequences are so thrilling it does feel as though there just aren't enough of them. If you are going in to Furiosa expecting to see Fury Road, mark two then you may be a little disappointed.

However, if you are all in on this futuristic dystopia that Miller has created them you will be in for a treat.",8.0,22 May 2024
The Mad Max Saga is Still on the Right Path,"In Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, I praised nearly everything. The story and the themes it deals with, storytelling, performances of the cast, especially the ones of Joy and Hemsworth, direction, visual and sound effects, action sequences, cinematography, violence, soundtrack, and ending are all excellent and have nothing to be said against them.

Regarding the flaws, from my point of view, I saw two flaws in the movie, first, some story elements which were overlapping and confusing, and second, the 148 minutes runtime, which was too long to some extent. If the movie's runtime was 120 minutes, like Mad Max: Fury Road, that would have been much better.

I liked Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, and I am looking forward to see what the Mad Max franchise will have in the future. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga 8 out of 10.",8.0,25 May 2024
Witness Something Else?,"Furiosa as a prequel film missed the mark by several magnitudes. This was George Miller's attempt at telling a more sentimental and heartfelt origin story of his famed female hero, Furiosa; who was played more compellingly in 2015 by Charlize Theron.

While I understand the need to recast the part due to Theron's age, Anya Taylor-Joy lacked the grizzly survivalist grit and fierceness that would have justified her character's ominous mutism. Furiosa should fill that silence with her brooding, steely aura - but here it didn't land.

A lack of a consistent film score also jarred; as many segments went unillustrated by music with a strange foray into negative audio space that didn't achieve whatever Miller perhaps thought it would in potentially establishing intimate presence and rawness. It's a quiet film not helped by a quieter character in Furiosa. The main audio is probably the symphonic roar of engines.

Miller aspires to the Homeric and the biblical in this latest installment, but he cuts corners with an over-reliance on CGI and special effects. What set Fury Road apart from the rest was its markedly sparing usage of CGI; here we sadly see a departure from that standard and a step in the wrong direction.

We aren't treated to a thunderous cinematic thrill-ride with ambitious sequences. Instead it's a muddled patchwork detailing Furiosa's removal from the 'place of abundance' and her introduction into the wasteland - at the poignant cost of things very dear to her. Unfortunately Anya was not convincing in the role. Hemsworth as Dementus was good; although not an exceptional villain like Immortan Joe.

The world-building does certainly help underpin Fury Road, but it forgets to be exceptional in its own right, rather than solely derivative of its excellent sequel.",6.0,25 May 2024
Feel Furiosas Fury,"This is the definition of a Summer Artistic Action Blockbuster! We get all the action, explosions, huge set pieces, energy of a typical summer blockbuster with a directors artistic flare that makes this movie have more than the average. It's funny because like Fury Road there is not alot of dialogue between the characters so to say the movie is minimalistic while at the same time a bombastic film is ironic but true. Anya Taylor Joy delivers again with a great performance, you can almost know what she is thinking just by her facial expressions to where you don't feel like you're missing dialogue. She was perfectly cast. Chris Hemsworth this performance was one not to mess with! He gave you a true villainous performance to where he's diabolical, Evil, charming, and funny. He clearly had alot of fun being the bad guy and it shows and it pays off for the audience. I appreciated this prequel because it didn't just feel like just an origin story for Furiosa herself but one for the world of the wastelands and building more to it than taking it at face value. The movie runs 2.5 hours and you don't feel it at all because there's so much going on from characters to locations to action sequences it was just an experience. One that i had in 4DX which personally I do not recommend, because so much moving of the seats and seat punching you throughout that run time can take you out of the movie from time to time cause it is intense. I'd say doing a normal, rpx, or imax will do you a better experience.",8.0,3 June 2024
"Mediocre, George Miller.","I had hopes for more action and crazy stunts. Less CGI and a more solid story.

Instead I got bored, there was 10x more dialog.

The story on how Furiosa escaped was full of holes (a cult desperate for young healthy woman completely looking past her for years on end??).

Dementus was a glorified comedian and someone you could not take seriously. They couldn't even use the same voice effects for Immortan Joe as the 1st movie so he sounded like a small boy.

The 30 day war was a 10 second nothing.

It's a good movie but no way contends with the action scenes and stunts from fury road. It missed that action movie, edge of your seat vibe.

I witnessed it and It did not ride through the gates of Valhalla shiny and chrome.",6.0,26 May 2024
As Mad as a Box of Frogs...,"A film about a lass who gets abducted, although her mother does her best she is obstructed, in a world dystopian, acquires a new custodian, loses her voice, as over time, she is corrupted. But as she grows she takes her chances and excels, in this world that's comprised of living hells, fighting for chance to escape, a wonder woman without cape, but with a passion and a fury to compel. The CGI is overwhelming and immense, the story quite intriguing - sometimes tense, the acting as expected, you may find yourself connected, on occasion there's a hint of taught suspense - but the editing is a bit rubbish on occasion.",8.0,3 June 2024
"Decent prequel, a bit too long","Kidnapped from her home and the land of abundance, Furisoa vows to her mother that she will one day return. With her wit, cunning, and singular goal of returning home, she creates opportunities to escape danger and survive in the Wastelands. With the passage of time and the chaos of Wasteland politics, Furisoa reprioritizes her goal and becomes the legend of Fury Road.

This movie is the prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road. While this movie has the same awesome action and post-apocalyptic feel as the first, it has a drawback. The story is excellent and expands on the character of Furisoa, gives some history as to how the world ended up in the state it is in, and expands on the history and dynamics of Wasteland and the colonies that exist in it. Since it is a prequel, the audience knows what is in store for the main character, making some of the story predictable. Another drawback is the length; with Furisoa's story already known, some parts could have been shortened or obliterated, keeping the audience engaged without feeling like the movie was dragging on. Overall, the movie is entertaining, expands on the overall story of the Mad Max saga, and sets up the potential for more. This is an excellent watch in theaters for franchise fans or anyone looking for an action-packed movie.",7.0,29 May 2024
Miller has gotten senile,"Insane how good the reviews are for this. Too much CGI and green screen makes it feel like a cheap Marvel film. Too many ""mission"" scenes that become like a videogame experience. One after another these generic villains get blown away and you stop caring after the 800th one. It is also really gross which is an unwelcome change from FR. Maggots, amputation, and body horror that feels like a bait and switch from what we were promised. That brings us to the worst component and why the movie fails, comparable to why the fourth Matrix failed. The casting. Anya just cant carry a film like this no matter how much gritty makeup they cover her in. Any time she talks all tough you want to just cringe. They knew this so gave her as few lines as possible and just made her look cool. But you can't hang a film on an actor with such little charisma. And what on earth is Chris Hemsworth doing in this movie? He is badly miscast and half the time you wonder how he's supposed to be the villain when he's so light hearted and likeable. This kills the core of the revenge story. You should be hating him more than she does. The other guy, the guy she teams up with should have been the villain--he looks and acts ice cold--and Hemsworth should have taken his role. The movie tried to cover up the flaws with cool looking shots, and at times I felt this is so trashy that they must be doing it as a gag. But no it is dead serious. This is a major step down from Fury Road, it is not carrying the torch of action filmmaking like that film did, with real stunts and old school effects, in the way it was nominated for ten Academy Awards. It's like Miller has gotten senile, every single decision is more baffling than the last.",1.0,23 May 2024
"Well done origin story, awesome piece","I was worried that the change in lead actress for Furiosa would be just the tip of the iceberg when it came to what issues this origin story would have.

I was blown away at how amazing the actress was who stepped into Furiosa and was able to pull off this characters story after stepping in.

The story was feasible as it fit seamlessly into the world of Mad Max.

Most origin story movies are terrible but Furiosa was an amazing tour de force in the Mad Max world.

Anna Taylor Joy did a wonderful job stepping into Charlize Theron's character. The fact that they were both ballerinas as children was one of the reasons she was chosen by the director.",8.0,2 June 2024
Dishonest,"This is why Fury Road sucks. Many of us predicted this then and you called us mysoginists and dellutional, but here it is. They did what we knew they would, what we said they would. They made Mad Max without Mad Max.

I could potentionally (and maybe even probably) enjoy the stories if they weren't so disrespectful. Why not just in an interview say they were deepely inspired by Mad Max. It was stories you imagined when watching Mad Max as a kid. Hey you could even say it takes place in the Mad Max universe and it'd make sense because surely he wasn't the only one who had experiences in that world. Just don't try to take advantage of the name just so you can save money on advertising you'd have to spend to gather interest in a new franchise and then NOT give us Max.

And no, saying it is a Mad Max Saga isn't the same. Rogue one didn't say it was a Luke Skywalker story, it said it was a Star Wars story. And guess what? It WAS a GREAT Star Wars story!

If you still need me to explain the difference to you here it is in short.

The name Mad Max focuses on the character Max. The name Star Wars is unspecified and can easily include all things that happened in the galaxy far, far away.

Now is this (to some people, a very small point) important enough to go on this sort of rant? Well my principles (and maybe primarily my OCD) says yeah, it is.

So anyway, go ahead. Judge me! However I think honesty is important. Especially from someone who's trying to sell you something.",,28 May 2024
A Welcomed Prequel Expansion to Fury Road,"A welcomed prequel expansion to Fury Road but nowhere near as tightly knitted. The frenetic pacing has been completely ditched for a different type of story telling. Makes sense since this film spans decades meanwhile Fury Road is a couple days. Despite that, going in I thought it was going to be another rollercoaster ride but immediately I had to change and adjust to Furiosa's style of storytelling.

Chris Hemsworth steals the show like Charlize Theron did in Fury Road.

I have issues with the story structure and focus. Miller wanted to expand the world and tell Furiosa's origin but seemed to unable to balance the two together. There are title cards seperating each segment of the film into parts. I would have prefered the film without these, they feel so uninspired with the simple white basic font too.

The pacing takes a hit since the structure has some issues but in the end it does all come together nicely. Did this blow me away like Fury Road did? No which does leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth while leaving the cinema but the action is still a spectacle. There were concern with CGI usage and in the final film, it is prevalent but there are sequences that I wouldn't know how else people would create it with the framing. I don't mind it and it didn't break immersion.

Character developments was done off screen at time which confused me since this is an origin story so the whole point is to get the audience to connect with the character more. I don't think the runtime is used at it's full potential. There are several moments that last too long and others that are completely glazed over which would have been so interesting to see, even perhaps a film dedicated to that part.

The expansion of the world is some of the best parts. The dynamic of the 3 central points and how the wasteland functions was cool to see. Furiosa doesn't have nowhere near as much replay value as Fury Road but it is worth watching at least once even if you're not a die hard fan to appreciate the world building and action setpieces George Miller crafts. The man still hasn't lost his touch which is mindblowing.",8.0,25 May 2024
One of the best action films of all time.,"The only reason I'm not giving this film a 10 is because I feel like the ending could have been more fleshed out and climactic. Especially the Dementus storyline. In every other way, it is from start to finish an absolute masterpiece. The imagery is jaw dropping. The scale of the thing demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. Very rarely will we ever have a chance to marvel at something like this. The wasteland looks incredible. The biker horde and the design of the costumes and vehicles is outstanding. The War Rig chase scene is breathtaking. I loved all the characters, despite the fact that many of them are evil lunatics. The leads all give amazing performances in my opinion, and the music really keeps you watching on the edge of your seat. George Miller has done something really special with Furiosa and Fury Road. You don't miss Max at all. Jack fills in that vacancy nicely. Overall, one of the most epic cinematic creations ever made.",9.0,25 May 2024
True anti-war movie,"Someone will say this is Fury Road again and they won't be wrong. This time director went even further, deeper into dissecting human nature. He remained true to his vision. From the beginning, through all the action and violence, the film screams in your face: this is where you are going, be better or your children will suffer a similar fate.

From the start it imposes senseless cruelty as a new reality and whether we like it or not is no longer important. The moment when we had the opportunity to choose is behind us.

If there is no greater purpose of art than to remind us to be humane, then this is a masterpiece.",10.0,23 May 2024
"Prequel is serviceable, but NOT on the level of ""Fury Road""","After George Miller's 2015 masterpiece ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" revitalized not only its franchise but the action genre as a whole, expectations were sky-high for the next entry in the series. I remember being blown away by seeing ""Fury Road"" on the big screen back in 2015, and I was hoping that this gritty and often brutal prequel about Furiosa's childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood would help complement that film and stand alone as a compelling and action-packed entry in the series. Prequels aren't particularly easy to get right, particularly when it comes to establishing a sense of purpose and creating clear stakes and dramatic tension to keep the audience engaged even when they think they know the ultimate outcome of the story. But as we clearly know by now, Miller doesn't do things the easy way, so I didn't expect that to be much of a problem. Ultimately, I thought ""Furiosa"" was fine, but it sometimes feels flawed and dull in a way that ""Fury Road"" obviously isn't.

Running a lengthy but never lethargic 2.5 hours (which is a lot longer than previous movies in the series,) the film's primary plot centers on Furiosa seeking revenge against the evil Dementus (Chris Hemsworth.) Anya Taylor-Joy does well as Furiosa, always establishing a commanding sense of rage and trauma, but Chris Hemsworth sometimes over-acts as a sometimes-vicious, sometimes-campy, sometimes-Shakespearean sort of villain who ends up being a bit all over the place thematically. While the film does a good job establishing world-building, the plot still isn't especially unique, efficient, or consistently engaging despite being a bit dragged out. Audiences don't end up learning as much about Furiosa as a character as we would expect for a prequel that is this long. There are two prolonged action scenes that are very technically impressive, but the action is definitely not as good (and nowhere near as frequent) or ingrained in the story as in ""Fury Road."" Yet on the positive side, Taylor Joy's performance is generally strong, and the movie is still gorgeously shot, edited, and scored while always staying very visually engaging. While topping ""Fury Road"" probably would have been impossible, it's just at least a little disappointing that this film couldn't have been at least a little better or a little more purposeful. 6/10

Note: My ranking of the franchise, from best to worst, is as follows: Fury Road, The Road Warrior, Mad Max (the first movie,) Furiosa, Beyond Thunderdome.",6.0,25 May 2024
A brilliant Prequel,"I'm an avid Mad Max fan and I was always left disappointed by Fury Road. Although Tom Hardy is one of those great actors, I think it is without one of his weakest films. Furiosa has re-booted the franchise for me. Tom Burk was fantastic and Chris Hemsworth carried out a decent job. Anya Taylor Joy played a brilliant strong female lead, which was convincing and very watchable. I know this film has gotten a lot of criticism but having watched Furiosa it is very unjustified. Nice little nods to Fury Road and Mad Max. Furiosa brings back the humour of the original Mad Max films nicely.

Exactly as promised,"This film is exactly what you want it to be. Stylistically it stays true to Fury Road, from costumes to makeup to choreography the continuity between the two is beautiful to watch.

This is by no means simply a remake however. This film manages to pack in as much story as possible while sticking to the pace and action that lovers of Fury Road know and love. The fight scenes were choreographed so satisfyingly and were a pleasure to watch to the point where they seemed almost like a dance. However with the new character depths explored in this film, the audience could take pleasure in some particularly gruesome punishment scenes (while sticking to the age rating).

Once you get over the fact that Chris Hemsworth has funny prosthetics, his character adds comedy and darkness in equal measure. Not sure why they gave Anya Taylor-Joy such a bad wig. How funny that both her and Tom Hardy are notable for their 'eye acting' in their main roles.

I loved the film, and I was hungover while I watched it. Which says a lot.",9.0,2 June 2024
For 6,"I'm not impressed with this movie, although I didn't expect it to be possible to top Fury Road.

George Miller, both as a director and as a screenwriter, did not achieve the effect of the previous film.

Also, it's a good thing Charlize didn't play Furiosa in this movie, because this is below her level.

There is a lot of transparent pathos in the film and it lacks the energy that Tom Hardy, Charlize, Nikolas, Hugh bring to the last film ... Chris doesn't act badly in this movie, it's just that the role he plays is completely irrelevant, not to mention the personal stuff between him and Furiosa.

I expected more from the movie and I'm kind of disappointed.

Maybe it's because Fury Road blew me away, so I didn't quite find the same weight in this movie.

This whole movie was the main two characters chasing each other back and fourth. Every time one would walk away from the other, i would sigh, because that meant another inevitable hour of nonsense.

Decent,"I love all of the Mad Max films, most of all Fury Road, but overall, I found Furiosa to be just alright. Not great. Lots of action and a brisk pace for most of its runtime, but it doesn't match its predecessors.

Unfortunately, there's one huge problem: the last half hour. It slows way down and starts to feel like it will never end. I found myself just waiting for it to wrap up, which was disappointing because it overshadowed the otherwise enjoyable experience.

The performances from the actors were solid, and the script was competent, providing just enough depth to keep things interesting. The action scenes were well-executed for the most part, and while the effects were decent, there was definitely room for improvement. Initially, I was a bit worried about the obvious CG. However, as the movie progressed, this concern faded and became less distracting. Still, disappointing. The story was exciting, but the weak ending dragged it down.

Despite these flaws, I would give it a B. It had its moments and was entertaining for the most part, but the disappointing final act and some technical shortcomings prevented it from being truly great.",,26 May 2024
"Guns, Gus and Furiosa","An epic action movie perfectly built from start to finish with excellent action sequences and drama.

However, the highlights of the movie (except from the action) are the performances of its cast. Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Burke, offer the performances of their lives.

The prequel gives us the full backstory of Furiosa and completes her character as we witness her past struggles and the reason she is so tough. A truly legendary character development.

And last but not least the Mastermind director George Miller creates one of the best prequels and actions movies of all time in general. He chose the best cast and he crafted a phenomenal piece of art.",10.0,30 May 2024
Great movie. Just don't compare it to Fury Road,"This is a great movie with a very well expanded background story of the main character, her beginning and basically up to where Fury Road begins. If you spend your time comparing a prequel to the original film that many people describe as epic, the prequel loses every time. As good as Fury Road was, I'm not a huge fanboy so I think that helped me enjoy this film more. It had all the great things miller did in the first film, minus some of the grit, while bringing a fresh story to the screen. However it is not a Mad Max Story. So if you think you will be pissed off if you don't see any Mad Max action, then skip the movie or at least the crao review.",9.0,30 May 2024
Miller with just a hint of Tarantino,"Given Fury Road we know where this story ends and approximately where it will start. And we have a bit of dread that it will just be a straight line between them It is not a straight line The movie is broken into 5 chapters (a la Tarantino) with each chapter going new places and giving world building. Where the Mad Max movies give us Max, sn environment, and Max fighting to overcome that environment, this movie gives us a whole world--geopolitics, survival tools, economy--and then throws in a sociopath trying to make it all hid There are no good guys except the person we know cant win, which is surprisingly liberating as the factions square off The wasteland debris turned weapon tech is fresh while not unfairly surpassing Fury Road (set in the future) Allegedly george wrote this script to give Charlize background for Fury Road. This allows tremendous continuity between not only these 2 movies but the video game that came out near the time of Fury Road I expected to be annoyed at replacing Charlize with Anya, but it was a good move. Not just for her younger looks but for the innocence that shatters through the movie I loved every minute of this movie.",10.0,25 May 2024
Hemworth was not a great choice as Dr. Dementus,"The movie is compelling, and action packed with a bit of a sagging middle nonetheless another outstanding Mad Max movie. However if I had to complain about one thing it would be the casting of Chris Hemsworth as the major protagonist Doctor Dementus.

The ugly truth is Chris is not an actor- he's a movie star. His performance was not up to the standards of previous main male characters in other Mad Max movies. This one didn't have the character of Mad Max to lean on so it was even more important that the Doctor Dementus character be a major force.

Hemworth is no Tom Hardy- his performance was as wooden as any of his Avenger performances and the movie suffers from this.",8.0,28 May 2024
It's... Fairly good... But...,,7.0,21 May 2024
The most brutal and nightmarish vision of our future. 75+%,"If you saw ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015, reviewed at this site by me) and wanted to know the backstory of the heroine of that film, Furiosa, you should enjoy this. Here we first encounter Furiosa as a young child (played by Alyla Browne) and see the circumstances under which she wound up in the harem of Immortan Joe in the earlier film. Watching how that happened, my initial thought was that young Furiosa had herself to blame for her subsequent circumstances but on reflection, her actions at the beginning of this film were justified.

These early scenes with a young Furiosa I found to be really narratively engaging. There wasn't the kind of hectic action that you associate with Mad Max films (as in extended car chase scenes) and it didn't suffer from this in the slightest. In fact, if that storytelling strength continued on in this way, I would have scored the film at least 80%. At some point, however, the storytelling turned to things (i.e. Action) happening. No doubt for fans of the Mad Max franchise that is entirely as it should be.

Apart from the initial storytelling, another thing that pleased me were the echoes from the past that I saw. When Dementus (the leader of a huge gang) first appears (played by Chris Hemsworth), you could mistake him for the title character in a film about Jesus. In a later action scene, Dementus takes part in an event which closely resembles something quite famous in The Iliad. Then there's the whole absurdity of how he rides about on his 'chariot' like Ben-Hur or something. The last time that we see Dementus in this film, it struck me as something which could have been recounted in Classical antiquity. In any case, Furiosa will have to navigate such tyrants if she is to keep her promise to her mother to return from whence she came.

Maybe I could have scored this film 77.5% but I found myself getting lost and not seeing the bigger picture, so to speak. There was all this action happening but the strategy behind it wasn't conveyed easily to me. There was talk of there being 3 fortresses in the wasteland but I can't say that I remember what the first one was. Dementus spoke of wanting to have a meeting of warlords (himself, Immortan Joe, I think, and someone else, perhaps) by a certain time. It seemed to me as if that talk came to nothing. Sure, stuff happened, but why? What was the strategy behind it? Maybe these questions would be more easily answered in a setting outside of the cinema, where you could have the luxury of pausing and rewinding the film in order to more better follow what was happening. Or maybe there could have been better exposition through what the characters said.

Not having seen ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" since it was released in the cinema a few years ago, I can't say how the two films gel chronologically. Watching the end of this latest film, I had the impression that maybe it ends pretty much exactly where the previous film begins, as far as the time period goes.

Another thing which made me question how successfully the two films gel was some scenes between an older Furiosa (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) and a man. Now, this man made me wonder if he was who I thought that he might be. The closing credits confirmed his identity to me in any case*^. Given that, I now wonder if the scenes in this film will gel with the chronologically later film, as in does Furiosa actually recognise this man when she first meets him in the earlier film? If not, what would explain that? In my review of the earlier film, I lamented a casting choice made in it and here the ripples of that choice muddy the water, so to speak.

To explain my comment in the heading here about this being the most brutal and nightmarish of any in the Mad Max franchise, well, that's because some of the imagery here is worthy of the Apocalypse. Sometimes I caught a glimpse of something or thought that I heard someone say something horrific and I would question whether I actually saw or heard what I thought I did. 'Fortunately', such things would be revisited and you would realise that, yes, you did see and hear what you thought you did.

Random notes:

















*^ N. B. I think I may have misinterpreted what happened and I think that was intentionally orchestrated by the director, George Miller. Rewatching the film might clarify my mistake. The day after I posted this review, I read a review here by arogers-72852 and they also mention how confusing the film can be but if they're right, they clarify the issue of the man that confused me and a name in the closing credits (their review gives more detail than I like to give, though). It's easy to miss details watching films in a cinema.",8.0,29 May 2024
Cheap knock off version of the original,"Cheap I meant both literally and hypothetically . This film was a cgi abomination. Fury Road used vfx and cgi to enhance the experience but this time they made most ""cool"" action sequences in front of a green screen. Only a few of them were real stunt work. Which I am sure they were George Miller's efforts to cover up the studio's greedy choices.

I can swear the studio made this film with only economical purposes. The first one made hundreds of millions. They just wanted to milk a bit more just like any other money hungry media conglomerates. I am looking at you Disney.

The story was easy to understand and within minutes I was able to comprehend at first. Then, of course with the pressure of the studio, Miller chose to give us only the glimpses of the awesome fights we saw in the og. Too many time jumps made me utterly confused about the plot at some point.

I also have to mention that there were some action scene which would have been much better with some MUSIC. Music was one of the main things that were missing from this film. Sound effects generally were worse.

At the end, I was begging Furiosa to finish her long unnecessary speech so I can go home. I didn't do this in the og. In fact, we absolutely didn't need this film. Or any other prequels. Furiosa was a mysterious warrior for us. This one chewed all the awesomeness of hers and spat back this half baked put-together. Hell, when they showed scenes from FR in the end credits they made the film look even worse imo since that lead people to do direct comparison on the site and I can swear they didn't leave the theatre happy.

I am so sick of these greedy companies. This was the second franchise continuity I watched this year. The first was Dune 2. Now I am not sure whether I am gonna be able to watch Deadpool 3 or not. If I am paying high ticket prices I demand quality!",6.0,23 May 2024
"Wow! It is an actual gem, deep emotional and packed with action!","I personally liked this movie much more than the predecessor. Brilliant casting for young Furiosa, I felt every tear and hardship. Rocked me to my core, I understand so much more about this premise and it puts into perspective the very core of humankind. Chris was absolutely fantastic as the villain, a real evil leader. The motivations behind his persona were unveiled thorough the movie which in my opinion were quiet heart-breaking.

The ending dialogue between the two resonated with me immensely, if you had in front of you the person that caused you the most harm in this world... what would you do to them? Regardless of your answer, whatever they took from you will never come back, whatever you do to them, can never make up for what you have already lost.

Editing??,"Some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. Frequently throughout the film they filmed the action/driving at slower speeds and then sped it up in post resulting in a silent film era or 3 Stooges feel. I cannot for the life of me fathom what were they thinking?

Also, for the first portion of the film the lead Furiosa is played by a child and the action, acting, dialogue and feel of the movie all felt like those moments in the Kenobi series when the bad guys struggled to catch a young princess Leia running through the woods. Absolutely hilarious for all the wrong reasons.

Throw in some awful CGI, mediocre action and an uninteresting lead and this movie falls flat across the board. How can anyone call this a masterpiece or the action film of the year is beyond me.

The best prequel ever made,"I saw Furiosa in a ScreenX thetar and this film was so good that as soon as I left the theater I couldn't decide if it's better than Dune Part Two, but it's not. A lot of things were better than Mad Max Fury Road, like for instence Anya Taylor Joy is a better Furiosa than Charlize Theron, the film itself is as good as Mad Max Fury Road, but it is better than the old films. I just really think that George Miller needs to make a sequel to Fury Road. I heard he has an idea for a Max prequel.

It is too early to predict but I believe this film will go to the Oscars and might be nominated for cinematography, director, costume design, makeup and more since Mad Max Fury Road won 6.

The film has such beautiful cinematography, such a great soundtrack, script, actors, action... everything was so good. I can't think of anything I didn't like about this film.

"More than a movie, a burning epic ode to cinema and storytelling as a whole","High-octane fresco of the greatest mastery that is, or if a blend of punk and heavy metal had a visual language in order to tell you and show you an initiatory journey of the most explosive dramaturgy.

The storytelling is a pure never ending rollercoaster of the highest intensity, with at the same time, a lot of emotional depth and philosophical layers...

Anya Taylor-Joy as always kills it and takes over the frame with depth and silent strength... The evolution of Furiosa throughout the story is quite a bliss to experience and witness. From a survivor with a dream, to a chameleon with a spirit of vengeance, to a leader for the sake of reigning in order to live on and eventually make this broken dream into something real again (?) Chris Hemsworth's character of Dementus is the perfect mirror to Furiosa's dark side while he is the very instigator of this ""Imperator"" in the making.

Important to mention that, even if Anya Taylor-Joy is technically the lead role of this movie, the fact is that the majority of the lines of the movie are majestically served by a Chris Hemsworth at the top of his game ! I don't know if it's Oscar worthy, but he for sure delivered a truly great performance from beginning to end (and what a mesmerizing ending that invites you to reflection).

The whole piece is -as expected- highly flattering for your very eyes, while your heart rate is very probably gonna reach some dragster type of speed !... The settings, like in Fury Road, are dirty & decayed while hitting you with rich rusty shades of orange, red and yellow....and it's heavy on metal of course ! Metal, gasoline and...adrenaline. The richness of the content of the film expands in many ways the lore of Mad Max, adding a lot of new tasty details that upgrade this fictional world and give it all even more meaning and importance.

To me, beyond the absolutely delightful photography of the movie and sheer mastery in the art of staging and framing action & characters... The big X Factor and bonus that amplifies the whole experience of the movie is the powerful humane vibrance at its core... It gives this uncommon movie an extra flavor that takes it up a notch and makes it a true masterpiece (but yeah, the extremely fine photography and crazy epic action makes it all otherworldly catchy, ngl) ; that's just like nothing else you've ever seen.",10.0,22 May 2024
A tale to be bold,"This is not Fury Road, nor should it be. The film has many of its predecessors high octane moments but fleshes out a deeper cut, revealing greater layers of its wound. I would say it's what Mad Max (1) was to the Road Warrior (Mad Max 2). Also it's one of those rare times where the trailer doesn't give away the many surprizes the film has to offer, in fact, the film isn't at all what I was expecting and what the trailers reveal, which is a good thing. If you are a fan of the wasteland world of the Mad Max saga, this adds a layer that makes you craving for more slices to be shared, I hope these stories are shared for years, please Mr Miller, let us not wait 9 more years, Maximum Fury should be the next title.",9.0,21 May 2024
Great Performances! But was the film needed?,"Was this movie really needed? When Mad Max: Fury Road came out in 2015, I was blown away by Charlize Theron's performance of Furiosa. She STOLE the screen from Tom Hardy's Mad Max.

The plot centers around Furiosa's abduction by the Biker Horde led by the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth. Throughout the film, Furiosa seeks revenge against Dementus. Her drive propels her into becoming one of Immortan Joe's key lieutenants, culminating in her commandeering the War Rig and meeting Joe's wives, setting the stage for the events of Fury Road.

While I was interested in her back story, I honestly believe that it would have been much better and more fresh in Mad Max fans' minds to release the prequel Furiosa movie only 3 or 4 years after Fury Road with Charlize Theron in the staring role as this prequel ends right where Fury Road takes off. In 2015, Charlize Theron was 40, while Anya Taylor-Joy is just a wee 28 year old. The long delay was because of legal disputes and the COVID-19 pandemic which unfortunately was unavoidable. Despite these challenges, the movie has been well-received and we now have this gem of a movie.

I love Anya Taylor-Joy as a performer. She has played in so many drastically different roles and always seems to put a bit of magic into them. She was able to embody the character of Furiosa But it was not quite the same as Charlize Theron's. It is very much like we are watching an alternate dimension of this character.

And was this movie really about Furiosa? Kind of. While the film focuses heavily on Furiosa's journey, it also explores the rise and fall of Dementus, highlighting themes of power and retribution. The dynamic between Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth provides a compelling contrast, with their performances adding depth to the narrative. The film blends intense action sequences with a broader exploration of the Wasteland's societal structures, offering a more intellectual perspective compared to the relentless action of Fury Road.

Overall, while some fans might question the necessity of this prequel, it enriches the Mad Max universe by providing a deeper understanding of one of its most intriguing characters, making it a worthy addition to the franchise.",6.0,24 May 2024
Epic ~60% of the time,"Firstly some context, I find Fury Road to be a near perfect movie, with hardly a foot put wrong throughout the entire thing.

Furiosa is a good movie that often approaches the greatness of Fury Road, but suffers from not being able to keep the foot on the throttle in order to tell its story.

The cast is solid: ATJ does so well to flesh out an underspoken character, and while I understand people's issues with Hemsworth's performance, I think he fits in the Mad Max universe just fine. He may be a bit too quippy (seemingly a side-effect of the MCU that has permeated cinema), but it's still a memorable and unique character performance.

The biggest issues I am having trouble looking past is the CGI, which is in such stark contrast to the amazing real-life production that it is often jarring; and the extremely excessive use of fast playback speed, which do help with the pacing of shots but are also jarringly obvious. Neither element feels natural, and I found myself focusing on them instead of being lost in the scene like I am so often with Fury Road.

Without these I would gladly give it a 9, but they drop it to an 8/10.

It's still well worth it for the excellent action scenes, memorable production design, solid story and attention to detail. It just doesn't quite live up to the high standard George Miller is capable of.",8.0,1 June 2024
Something was off,"You want it or not, a comparation with the old movie is automatic. The first thing that comes to mind is that it kinda drags the story. It lacks the flow of the previous. The main villan is unconvincing and I found myself many times not understanging how to categorise him. Is evil without a clear motive, powerful without convincing greatness. You don't know if you want to love him or not.

The actions scenes are ok, but no moment where I would thing it's something epic worthy. At times almost too much of the same.

Maybe the main problem was the script, neglected in the face of the many action scenes paired with fancy camera movement. The plot was ok, but it lacked a smarter way of putting it on the screen.",6.0,26 May 2024
Absolute thrill ride,"Watch this in a theater with Dolby cinema and Dolby atmos- you don't want to miss the seat rumbling with the engines.

True to the Mad Max legacy, and still directed by George Miller.

Chris Hemsworth melts into his role and delivers more than just eye candy.

The action, the vehicles, the explosions, the dust, the rumble, and the fast pace leave you glued to the screen. I would recommend planning your beverage intake so you don't have to miss anything or make a mad dash to the restroom and back. You know a movie is fantastic when people stop every few steps on the way down the stairs or walk up backwards from a bathroom break trying to catch every moment.

As thrilling as the original Mad Max with 2024 technology.",9.0,25 May 2024
"Wrong Cast, Too Long but good story...","This movie could have been so much more but failed to deliver on the hype. In my opinion the following annoyed me:

Chris Hemsworth seemed like he was trying to a Jack Sparrow impersonation, which really didn't work. Anya was not believable. The younger actors playing Furiousa did a better job. Pivotal events impacting particular characters were not impactful enough as there was not enough character development.

The action scenes particularly with the war rig felt repetitive and too long at times.

Expectations were very high after Mad Max and whilst it was an interesting story with amazing production, it otherwise failed to deliver.",6.0,1 June 2024

"I've only ever given 6 movies a 10, this is one of them.","This movie should be regarded as cinematic perfection. While ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was a visual and action-packed marvel, it often felt like a showcase of impressive camera angles and stunts. In contrast, ""Furiosa"" excels in every aspect where ""Mad Max"" fell short. It presents a deeply engaging story set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, exploring the transformation of an innocent child into a vengeful legend. The breathtaking cinematography, sound design, and score create an overall captivating experience. Some films are made to be experienced in theaters, and this is undoubtedly one of them. Chris Hemsworth and Anya Taylor-Joy deliver career-defining performances, solidifying this movie's status as a must-watch.",10.0,30 May 2024
"A Complex, Grandiose, Messy Epic That Isn't What You Think","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga was never going to be more Fury Road. It couldn't be. Fury Road was a once in a lifetime achievement that was great because many people had no real expectations for it prior to its release. A film in a long dead franchise that had gone through production hell for the better part of 3 decades. A new installment in a series that had one or at best two great installments, and one that was recasting its title character. The fact that Mad Max: Fury Road was good is nothing short of miraculous, but it wasn't just good. It was phenomenal. Loved by critics and audiences alike and did the unthinkable for a movie that amounts to a 2 hour long car chase: it was nominated for AND WON multiple Oscars. But before there was Fury Road, there was Furiosa, a script written by Mad Max series creator George Miller and co-writer Nick Lathouris at the same time that they wrote the script for Fury Road. A script that provided an in depth backstory for Charlize Theron's Fury Road character, Imperator Furiosa, and a script that was given to the cast and crew of Fury Road as something of a character/world Bible. Despite Theron's desires to film the Furiosa script first, Miller knew how costly of a gamble Fury Road was shaping up to be, and what he had in mind for Furiosa was even grander, more sprawling. Now, after 9 years of rumors and discussions about the movie possibly getting made (which allegedly included Warner Bros. Dicking around with greenlighting the movie), Miller's and Lathouris' Biblical level epic is finally in theaters, albeit with Anya Taylor-Joy stepping into Theron's shoes.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga begins with narration from a character known only as ""The History Man"", a type of verbal historian and storyteller who, if we're going with the Biblical metaphor here, proceeds to tell us 5 chapters from ""The Book Of Furiosa"". We follow Furiosa over a span of 19 years, from a 9 year old girl (played by Alyla Browne) taken from her home in The Green Place Of Many Mothers by followers of the warlord Doctor Dementus (played Chris Hemsworth), and her mother, Mary Jabassa's (played by Anyone But You star and model Charlee Fraser) attempted rescue of her and ultimate death at the hands of Dementus' men, we see her taken under the wing of Dementus, raised as his successor, ""Little D"" before he ultimately uses her as a bargaining chip to gain an increased level of power by trading her to fellow warlord Immortan Joe (played by Lachy Hulme, who takes over the role from the late Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the character in Fury Road), we see her learn to build and work on Joe's massive War Rigs before, as an adult, she's mentored by Praetorian Jack (played by Tom Burke), Joe's top War Rig driver, learning how to hone the skills she already has to defend herself and to be a War Rig driver herself before ultimately, rejecting her place as a pawn in a game played by Joe and an increasingly insane and power hungry Dementus. There is a lot to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. It truly is a saga in every sense of the word, and on that level, there's a lot to admire here.

That being said, just because I gave it a 10/10 rating, that doesn't entirely mean that it's a perfect movie. The biggest thing that people will take issue with is the use of CGI. A big part of the reason why Fury Road works as well as it does is because it stays true to what made the Mad Max films great: the use of practical effects, stunts and locations/sets while also pretty seamlessly blending use of CGI in with the real vehicular carnage. Furiosa forgoes that, opting instead to use very VERY blatent CGI backdrops and locations for many of the film's locations, setpieces and action scenes (the CGI flames that appear whenever flamethrowers are used are particularly agregious). When we have a movie like Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes still playing in theaters, a movie that used CGI and motion capture for 90% of the movie, there is no excuse for some of the shots in Furiosa to look like they do. And yet... it didn't ruin the experience for me. I genuinely can't explain it, but, if Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes looked like a modern AAA video game, something like The Last of Us Pt. 2, there are moments in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga that look like something out of a video game released 15-20 years ago, one that has an incredible story but the graphics haven't aged the best. It's in dire need of a remake or remaster, but it hasn't gotten one yet for whatever reason, and.. I won't lie and say there isn't an undeniable charm to it all. Furiosa is best viewed in the context that I chose to view it in: that we are being told stories about Furiosa by The History Man, who is attempting to tell us the truth (or at least as he was told it or experienced it) and put to bed a lot of the myths that The Wastelanders have created about the legendary Furiosa. Because of this, the film having an obviously fake looking quality to a lot of it kind of makes sense. It's not defendable, but it makes it make sense. What's more likely and not me reading far too deeply into the movie is that the film was already ambitious and expensive enough as it was WITHOUT having to build massive sets for locations like Gastown or The Bullet Farm and Miller knew that there was no way that he could tell the story he wanted to without the use of modern technology. Again, there's no excuse for it looking how it does, but it does read as a 79, almost 80 year old man realizing that he ultimately has to ""get with the times"". CGI aside, Furiosa does often buckle under the crushing weight of its epic story. Fury Road was a very simple Point A to Point B then back to Point A road trip/car chase movie that put much more emphasis on the action. Much more emphasis here is placed on world and character building. If Fury Road is a story about a woman reclaiming her story, her identity, which was stolen from her at a young age, Furiosa is the story about how that identity, that story was stolen from her and her place in the stories of the men who took it from her. Anya Taylor-Joy is absolutely phenomenal, portraying Furiosa's silent rage and fury, but also her resilliance, her hope that will ultimately, one day, guide her home. As is typical for the films in the Mad Max universe, Furiosa doesn't have a ton of dialogue (between the Browne and Taylor-Joy versions, the character has about 30 lines of dialogue, at least 40% of which come during a memorable scene in the film's climax), so much of Taylor-Joy's performance is based on facial experessions and especially her beautifully expressive blue eyes (seriously, Anya Taylor-Joy has some of the most expressive and emotive eyes in all of Hollywood and George Miller absolutely knew that). Taylor-Joy has already shown that she is VERY capable of playing female rage to varying degrees in movies like The VVitch, Thoroughbreds, Last Night In Soho and The Northman, but she is at peak female rage mode in Furiosa and it is GLORIOUS. That being said, as good as Taylor-Joy is as the title character, she's no match for Chris Hemsworth channeling mythologically acurste Thor and making a 5 course meal out of the scenery as Dementus. This is career best work for both Taylor Joy and Hemsworth.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is an exhilirating, firing on all cylinders revenge story fueld by rage and the franchise's trademark ""guzzoline"". It's also a film that surprised me with the places the story went. It never reaches the astronomical heights of its predecessor, but it reaches some genuinely astronomical heights of its own.",10.0,26 May 2024
Spectacular- Don't miss,"Chris Helmsworth played the best antogonist role in recent times.

Taylor and the girl who played her younger version is fabulous too

Action choreography- very rare to see these kind of stunts. Well done

Cinematography and CGI- Oscar worthy

As a audience, I can just say humble thanks to Miller for bringing this epic experience on big screens

My only feedback is, it could have been better with score, it's silent most of the times. There is definitely a big scope to have a excellent score.

Entirely, it's better than fury road with better story and character arcs.

Fury road is a nonstop action extravaganza

Furiosa is well balanced action thriller with good storytelling.

Mediocre,"Looks like George Miller too the easy way with Furiosa. You can tell the background is clearly cgi and vehicles are rolling along the green screen unlike fury road where practical affects dominated. No dust on vehicles, everything is pretty neat though it's supposed to be a wasteland.

Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny and psychotic. Anna Taylor Joy doesn't even come till halfway point where she takes over pre teen Furiosa. Furiosa was over shadowed by literally everyone.

Overall it's fun and a one time watch. Wish George Miller put as much effort into Furiosa as he did for Fury Road. 7/10.",7.0,24 May 2024
Better than Expected,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. Our family went expecting it to be OK. We ended up leaving very satisfied with this epic flick. Hemsworth's character is surprisingly both witty & despicable, but with the perfect dose. Taylor-Joy was fabulous in this badass role & she effortlessly brought you into her world of survival and revenge. The action & stunts were amazing. The art and technology in this film, made it a spectacular event as we marveled at the wasteland of the Mad Max universe. That's what I'm talking about.

"Good, but not as good as Mad Max: Fury Road","We have to admit that both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are far better actors than Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. Both Anya and Chris are beautiful, but their poor acting skills made this movie a flop. Mad Max: Fury Road's chasing scenes are epic, Furiosa just isn't as good, no major breakthroughs. Fury Road just raised the bar too high makes it too difficult to pass. Dr. Dementus performed by Chris Hemsworth is forcibly injected into the storyline with very little creditability. Anyway, a bad unconvincing script seems to be the biggest drawback of this film. Poor choice of actors is another problem, Anya has never done an action film before and Chris is just not suitable being a villain.",7.0,28 May 2024
Wasteland Rage,"'Fury Road' will go down as an action classic. I mean, heck it already is in my mind, it's almost ten years old. 'Furiosa' adds to the story by being a prequel to obviously Furiosa, but all the factions we saw in 'Fury Road'. We now know more of the back story to them and why they do what they do.

As for the film itself, lots of action, a feast for the eyes, but unfortunately an overuse of CGI. 'Furiosa' will be compared to 'Fury Road' in every category, and one of the biggest differences is the CGI vs practical effects. 'Fury Road' is a masterclass in practical effects, and 'Furiosa' was sadly the opposite.

Great performances by all. Hemsworth is practically unrecognizable with that nose and teeth. I'm not always the biggest fan of Taylor-Joy, but she was very good too.

This is no doubt a summer blockbuster and should be appreciated as such.",8.0,3 June 2024
Remember Me?,"Certainly a heavily stylized film and not one of conventional pacing, which comes with goods and bads. For one, the action sequences are flawlessly captivating, fluent, and elaborate, as every engine vroom and thunder-stick explosion are as authentic and adrenaline-inducing as they can be (imagine Waterworld live performance in Universal Studios but times 15). On the other hand, some of the segments are either overly trimmed (the actual forty-day Wasteland war) or overly extended (Furiosa's final showdown with Dementus). Obviously Miller intended to make the movie an epic biography tailored for one character only, but the issue is there's no side-plot to mix up the taste. Plus the lack of comedic elements, some parts of the film are quite insipid and rather sleepable. However, I'd still recommend if you have a good two and a half hour to immerse in the highly-saturated primally-brutal mechanically-overloaded weirdly-sexual world of George Miller.",6.0,28 May 2024
Furiosa Fiasco,"I was underwhelmed by the new film 'Furiosa', which attempts to reimagine the Mad Max franchise with a female lead. Unfortunately, this feminist twist falls flat.

The story is heavy-handed and preachy, with characters that feel like cardboard cutouts rather than fully fleshed-out people. The action sequences are few and far between, and when they do arrive, they're marred by poor editing and confusing choreography.

But the biggest problem I had was with the CGI. It's laughable how poorly rendered some of the visual effects are, with characters and vehicles looking like they were ripped straight from a PlayStation 2 game. It's clear that the budget for CGI was severely lacking, and it detracts from an already lacklustre film.

Overall, I was disappointed by 'Furiosa' and felt like it wasted the potential of its unique premise. Instead of a fresh take on the Mad Max universe, we get a shallow rehashing of familiar themes with little depth or nuance.",4.0,23 May 2024
On the road again.,"Welcome back to the Wastelands. After 9 years of silence, George Miller takes us back to the loud, greasy and bloody world of Mad Max in a worthy prequel to Fury Road. Movie theaters still exist for movies like this. Even the loudest and brightest IMAX screen doesn't do Furiosa justice. George Miller has contributed 40 years of world building that has surely enriched the massive scope that Furiosa relishes in. Anya-Taylor Joy is incredible here. By the film's end, she becomes eerily inseparable to Charlize Theron's portrayal in Fury Road. Chris Hemsworth absolutely chews up the screen as the bombastic Dementus. Both are glorious to watch onscreen. It's true that Furiosa doesn't reinvent the wheel or bring anything new to the franchise, but honestly, did it need to? God no. It's just endless fun.",8.0,3 June 2024

Furiosa: Mythic. Meditative. Mad as Hell!,"Epic AF! - it's a sort of side-quest film that takes place over years & years.

It's world building without calling attention to itself (because we're so honed in on Furiosa and her journey).

It's director George Miller taking a bit of a 'post-Fury-Road' victory lap...

... retracing his steps and shading in his canvas; adding more shadows, and allowing himself to embellish & letting his yarn gradually unfurl (in contrast to the franchise's leaner, hyper-edited previous installments).

Consequently (and, for myself, gratefully) we get even more of his endless rogues gallery of absurd/ grotesque/ tragic (etc.) Post-Apocalyptic characters.

It's sprawling, yet at the story's core is an elementally-simple dark-heart beat: a universal mythic tale of terrible loss and possible redemption (hopefully?).

A minor complaint might be that the film's CGI may have been a smidge too much on the 'uncanny' side of the valley; a minor quibble really when the craft is this impeccable.

Hemsworth is great as a sort of smarmy-anti-Thor.

Just Got of a Dolby Cinema Screening of Furiosa.

Anya Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth are So Good in This.

1 to 1 Comparison of Fury Road & Furiosa Below.

📜 Script Wise, Furiosa is Superior to Fury Road.


1. Furiosa(The Movie) has the Build of a Young Furiosa all the way up to Adult Furiosa and it's Very Good. How She met Immortan Joe etc. It also Feels more Expansive, doing little Bits of Exploring of 3 Locations (Gastown, Bullet Farm & The Citadel).

2. Fury Road is Furiosa Steals the 5 Wives, ""Bumps"" into Max, Tells Max that they're Heading to ""The Green Place"", Max Realises that ""The Green Place"" isn't there, and all of this is happening whilst Immortan Joe and his Army are Chasing Them across the Desert.



1a. Both Fury Road and Furiosa have Some Stunning Visuals, Both have Amazing Colour Palettes. Both have the Light Blue Sky Coupling the Orange Sand Shots. The Sandstorm Scene in Fury Road and That Blue Scene in Fury Road Looked so Good.

1b. The Very Ending of Furiosa when she is Beating Up Dementus and there is a Shot when her Neck was Amped Up with Veins Popping & Strong, Such a Breathtaking Shot.



1a. Fury Road has the 5 Wives who Certainly Add much to the film both performance wise and plot wise, it has Of Course Max who is Definitely Missed in Furiosa, it has Charlize Therons' Furiosa, it has Nux, it has a More Significant Performance by Immortan Joe.

1b. Furiosa has Furiosas' mother (Excellent Opening), it has Chris Hemsworth as Dementus who is Very Charismatic in this, it has Immortan Joe but he's not as Prominent in this, it Has Anya Taylor Joy as Furiosa (She's better than Charlize Therons' Furiosa in my opinion, ""You Fabulous thing"" as Dementus Puts it). It has Immortan Joes 2 Sons. And it has Praetorian Jack.



Just to name a few.

1. The Bike Jumping Scene in Fury Road, the Guitar Guy 🎸, the Pole Vaults in Fury Road, the Max Fighting Furiosa and the 5 Wives near the start of Fury Road.

2. Furiosa does have some Amazing Action, The Parachute Scene, The Sniper Scene & Dementus on top of the Tower Scene.





Overall, They're 2 Brilliant Pieces of Artistry within Cinema, 2 Distinct Masterworks in their own right imo. 1 tips the Scales in Story & 1 Tips the Scales in Action.",10.0,27 May 2024
Could have been better,"Still entertaining, but feels like recycled material from Fury Road. More time should be spent developing characters, but instead there are too many repetitive action scenes. Hemsworth's character fails to be either interesting or menacing; Furiosa is okay but doesn't have any serious ally to develop more as a character. Praetorian Jack should be more prominent; there should be some interesting sidekicks, but basically everyone apart from Furiosa and Dementus seems to be a part of the background. Dementus is also too similar to Immortal Joe and all other 'bosses'. I still hope there will be more to this saga, but I would like to see something fresh-there is literally nothing in Furiosa that we haven't seen in Fury Road.",7.0,26 May 2024
Instant Classic,"Tied with the best of the series Mad Max Road Warrior. Epic storyline and adventure, intertwined with politics, greed, deception and lastly revenge. Great acting by the main characters Ann Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. Photography was stunning, and the action scenes were mind blowing. The young Furiosa was a carbon copy of the grown version. George Miller managed to maintain his distinct signature of an all too believable take on humanity at its honest core of desperation and survival skills. The quest for valuable resources and the need for isolation from barbarians. I must see it again for another joy ride.",10.0,25 May 2024
a fun watch but missing something,"It's a good movie with all the expected visual impact and mayhem, but Furiosa doesn't really come across as a character like she did when Charlize Theron was playing her. For half the movie, the character is played by a child actor. Considering how non-verbal Furiosa is, it's hard to convey a character at all. Some actors can do it, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he has screen presence and an iconic bod.

Much of the plot is devoted to the political maneuverings of the two sides. There also was something off about the storyline, it was very simplistic. Too simplistic. Ride around, create mayhem, seek vengeance, repeat. I kept waiting for the surprise twist that never came.",7.0,28 May 2024
Epic Masterpiece for the Mad Max Saga.,"While I think Fury Road does look better (due to its less CGI visuals), I think I prefer Furiosa. It is much more brutal AND vengeful than the first to be honest.

Furiosa is pretty much an origin film of the titular Furiosa from the movie Fury Road. Here we see where she came from and how she became the person she was in the aforementioned film.

It really rallies a story of grief and survival. Every single time we see her brutalized, trivialized and be left on her own whim AND she in someway just survives. It tackles a very sensitive topic towards the end in such a rich way that I think Fury Road lacks. That key scene really pushes this film to masterpiece status to be honest.

Performance wise, Anna Taylor Joy (and her Child Actor counterpart, Alyla Browne) is more of trauma dump character. She is her knowing of her role AND it shows. She barely talks and mostly has glares in the film AND it really amps the end when she goes out and fully expresses her own. On a more showier note, Chris Hemsworth as the Nomad King Bandit, is such a great performance. He tends to better in comedy AND this funny yet brutal character really plays to his strength.

Also, I would commend the pace of the film. This is much complex than Fury Road but it was able to really truncate the lengthy runtime and its context-full story into a knit package. There was never really a moment when it felt that it was lagging. Though watching the first one does improve the experience a lot. My parents where a bit lost with a lot of the zip zapping stories in the film.

This is a great film. Highly Recommended.

PS: The only thing that bugs about this film's plot is that no one uses those flying machine to look out which way is the 'land' lol.",10.0,25 May 2024
It's a paved version of Fury Road,"Some of the action sequences especially on the paved road are jaw-dropping. The movie loses, for some reason, the raw and organic feel that Fury Road had. It feels a bit too Hollywood in comparison to Fury Road. Some are praising Taylor Joy's performance, but it felt like it was just her doing model poses. Even with all the make up she still feels a bit too model-like to portray this badass heroine. Hemsworth and the writers give the character too much silliness to it, he never comes off as the engrossing and repulsive antagonist that Immortan Joe was in Fury. There's one scene that Hemsworth sounded and embodied some of the mannerisms of Heath Ledger as the Joker.",7.0,3 June 2024
You need Mad Max to have a Mad max Movie.,"Im not sure why Hollywood is so into replacing men( especially men of a certain shade) in movies. We had the last James Bond, where 007 was a diverse woman. We had Star Wars now completely devoid of movies featuring this particular group. Odd, considering the story was originally staring two men. The Acolyte, Tales of the Empire, Ahsoka, the Bad Batch.... It just seems to be a theme in fantasy and sci fi. Prey was last with a skinny female who could beat up a Predator with a hatchet, something the biggest toughest men armed with machine guns could not do. Damsel, madame Web, the Marvels Rebel Moon... it's just getting to be too much.

It's really time to stop trying to replace men with women. Make fantasy and sci fi movies with male leads. Then eventually, you will get your audience back.

The best part of Furiosa were the male villains. What does that tell you?",2.0,28 May 2024
One of the best prequels in recent memory!!,This movie kicks ass from start to finish! It's one of the best prequels in recent memory. The pacing is great and the action scenes are done so well. The cinematography is amazing and it's so visually appealing like the first film. The storyline is great and in my opinion better than its predecessor. Anya Taylor-Joy nails her role as Furiosa and Chris Hemsworth is wonderfully menacing as Dementus.

Almost perfect,"I would say without any spoilers that this is a very enjoyable movie and a very important part of the franchise, somehow on the road you will feel that the story lacks on experience but this is quickly recovered while you pass on through so many uplifting and terrifying moments and scenes, the sound was just amazing and if you are in a good movie theater enjoyed even more, the music and the performance were really amazing and as it goes for the sounds a straight 10, somewhere on the road is a slightly noticeable CGI effect but not on the point where it could bother you, So my truly recommendation is that this is definitely worth watching even if you're not fan of this series.",10.0,29 May 2024
"Inferior to Fury Road, but better than the rest","Fury Road is the greatest action movie ever made, and matching it would be nigh on impossible. Furiosa isn't as good as Fury Road, but it's certainly way better than everything else out this year. I enjoyed it more than Dune 2.

Furiosa is the last good movie we will have for a long time, as the rest of 2024 looks to be awful.

I have seen Furiosa three times already, and will be seeing it a fourth time in IMAX this weekend. I haven't felt this enjoyment of a new movie since, well, Fury Road. I also very much want at least one more Mad Max movie out of George Miller, i.e. Wastelands, or another one with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, or even Mel Gibson himself.

The world building, action, acting, and direction by George Miller in Furiosa is just sublime. I didn't feel bored for a second during each viewing, although I also didn't once feel the peak high that Fury Road gives me. Maybe that's largely to do with Fury Road's epic soundtrack, and that sadly Furiosa wasn't adorned with its own epic soundtrack.

It's definitely my favourite Chris Hemsworth movie, he absolutely kills it, and Anya Taylor Joy is phenomenal, as well as Praetoeian Jack's actor, and the young Furiosa actress.

It's not the high octane ""inject this movie directly into my veins"" powerhouse that is Fury Road, nor does it give me a similar feeling of catharsis, and yes it feels like it could have been better, especially given what George Miller showed us he's capable of with Fury Road, but after 3 viewings so far, I still don't feel bored of it.",9.0,30 May 2024
One of the Best Prequels Ever,"Many a time, the movie-going (or TV watching) public watch an EPIC saga and think - ""I wonder what happened in the events leading up to this"". And, many of the time, the ensuing prequel movies (or TV shows) are lacking in quality and common sense (I'm looking at you, Star Wars, Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games).

They all could have taken tips from George Miller, for he has come up with the definitive prequel film - FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA.

Following a character introduced in 2015's MAD MAX FURY ROAD, this film follows the titular FURIOSA (played in FURY ROAD by Charlize Theron) as she grows from young girl to adult savior in a post-apocalyptic Australia.

FURY ROAD was ""gonzo"" - an over-the-top action/visual fest that was going to be hard to top...and Miller has done precisely that by presenting even more over the top sequences and characters (most notably, Chris Hemsworth's Dr. Dementus - more on him later) juxtaposed against a character (Furiosa) who is grounded in reality and is relatable to the audience.

Credit for this credibility goes to the 2 performers playing her - Anya-Taylor Joy (THE MENU) who plays the older Furiosa (though younger than the Theron Furiosa of FURY ROAD) and Alyla Brown (TRUE SPIRIT) who plays the young Furiosa. Both actresses embody the character of Furiosa with a strength and a determination that shines through their eyes as they endure...and survive...the trials and tribulations of living in a post-apocalyptic world.

And then there is the over-the-top performance of Hemsworth (Thor in THE AVENGERS films) as the main antagonist of the film. To say that Hemsworth's performance is over-the-top is to not do justice to the phrase over-the-top. He is way-way-way-way over-the-top, but for some reason it really, really works in this film.

And, that is because Writer/Director Miller once again mines his fertile imagination to bring an unthinkable world to life with bizarre, yet human, characters who have gone feral utilizing cyber-punk vehicles and weapons in a most ingenious world go wrong.

And, of course, there are the exhilarating battle scenes and chases that are at the core of this film...and every Mad Max adventure...and these do not disappoint as they are well staged and choreographed and are exciting to watch all bringing us right up to the point where Mad Max: Fury Road begins.

All-in-all, a rip-roaring fun time at the Cineplex. The rollercoaster ride of the summer.

"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","I could say all the things. George Miller has run out of ideas. Nothing fresh or new here. Chris Hemsworth kind of ruins it by being Chris Hemsworth. The CGI is off in places (and *really* off in other places). It's just not Fury Road.

And it isn't.

But we wanted more Mad Max, and this is it. Well, so to speak. Aside from maybe the most teasing of cameos, Max is nowhere in this story.

But we wanted more Furiosa, and this is it. What did we expect? Furiosa's fate is set. And so this film moves like a conveyor belt towards an end we know is coming, stopping at all the places we've already been. Gastown, the Bullet Farm, the Citadel. Just about every Fury Road character is back, too. Immortan Joe, of course, and his weird sons. The guy with the big fat foot and the guy with the snarling snaggletooth... you get the idea.

All but Max. Instead of Max, we get Dementus (Hemsworth), and, for a little while, a Pretorian (sp?) called Jack (Tom Burke). But it doesn't quite add up to Max. And a film that's part origin story, part love story, part tale of vengeance, doesn't quite add up to Fury Road, either. With it's furious tempo. And it's jaw-dropping scale. And its Charlize Theron and its Tom Hardy. And it's NOVELTY. By God, we hadn't seen a Mad Max film in THIRTY YEARS when Fury Road came out. Now it's barely been ten, and honestly it feels like just yesterday that Tom Hardy was chewing through his iron mask and Charlize Theron was deftly shifting gears on her war rig, looking like a total bad a$$.

When Fury came out, it felt rich with backstory. We didn't know anything about Furiosa - we gleaned it. We didn't know about the concubines she was rescuing; it was slowly revealed to us. Fury didn't explain itself. The Warboys had their own culture, their own words for things -- we just accepted it as we barreled along. Everything was new and shiny.

I said I wasn't going to say all of this. But I am. Because we wanted this, yes, we wanted more Max, erm, Furiosa, but we wanted something new, too. Not just a retread of all the places we'd been. Not just a spelling out of all the things we'd gleaned through the subtleties of the first film. Oh, she lost her arm THAT way?

You know what? I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

The not knowing is better. The mystery is better. This felt like Miller didn't really have a story to tell. He told us all the things he hashed out in the writer's room prior to Fury road and left out of the script as backstory to inform performances and make things feel three-dimensional.

Origin stories are for superheroes, maybe. Could you imagine a film that explained how Bruce Willis's John McClane was in the military, and then became a New York cop, and some of the stuff he went through with Holly, all leading up to their separation and him getting on a plane out to LA to see her? Die Hard works because we don't really know any of that. We accept his skills and fearlessness. It's hinted at he's no ordinary cop. We don't need it spelled out.

Furiosa was good. There were some fun moments. But it didn't feel necessary the way Fury Road did. That vital film, one I can't imagine not existing. I can imagine this one not existing.

"Stop comparing, this one takes a complete different approach","All I see is people comparing Furiosa with Furry Road but this is not a competition. Even though Furiosa is a prequel, this movie, unlike FuryRoad, aims to talk about one character, and the focus is on this character in a very specific way. Saying this, the movie kept me on my chair the whole time. The scenery, the vibe is the same of the other movies, the actions scenes are breathtaking just like the other movies, but the story goes deep into how furiosa became Furiosa, so strong and vulnerable at the same time, the main actress does an amazing job portraying a character who almost doesn't say anything, and yet is so powerful just by the actions and the expressions. All the acting is good in general, and if you think you will see a vilan version of Thor, you won't, Hemsworth is surprisingly good at making this vilan so captivating with only a few moments of fun, the character is cruel and solid.

The only fault in my opinion, was that sometimes the action scenes were a little bit too incredible even for a scifi movie like this one, if they had these scenes made with more believable effects the movie would've been perfect.

I personally liked this one more than Fury Road, I felt more tension and I like how they portrayed Furiosa, as she should be, a silent and furious woman, who suffers in her silence, who at the same time, seek for vengeance, and it's eager to survive without losing her compassion and hope for humanity.

Even though it's a prequel Furiosa and FuryRoad don't have a lot in common, but there's nothing wrong with that..",9.0,31 May 2024
I was hoping I'd be wrong,"When I saw the trailers for this, one thing stuck out, the terrible and excessive use of cgi. Considering this franchise is built on practical stunts and crazy car chases, it was disappointing to see so much of it. I wasn't expecting fury road, but it was distracting to the point of ruining most scenes.

Runtime and focus was another issue. The beginning dragged, the middle was rushed (I'm going to train you, next scene - ok you're trained), and the ending rushed through some great ideas. I think they could've shaved 30 mins, told the same story and used the extra money to polish up all the cgi (or go out and actually do it).

It still gets credit for good world building, some creative action scenes, and the acting by everyone was spot on (Hemsworth was having a blast and was great). It was just very disappointing how bad it all looked. It was more glaring since we had watched all 4 mad max films to prepare.

Also, bring back Max please.",7.0,25 May 2024
"Do you like bad CGI? Like, a LOT of bad CGI","Watched this in IMAX in a nearly empty theater (bad sign) and there are some good things about this film. The performances are interesting, the vehicles ares cool as always and the costumes are great. That's where the good ends and the bad begins. There is an absolute onslaught of CGI and blue / green screen backgrounds in this movie that made it impossible to enjoy. The majority of the ""chase"" scenes are people standing on stationary vehicles with a very obvious generated background making it look like they are moving. Almost all of the stunts that were performed by live actors in the first movie are clearly badly generated CGI in this. Form the awkward way they fall / move / jump around, it is absolutely awful how cheap and fake this entire movie looks. I'm talking late stage MCU lever CGI throughout. And there could easily be an hour cut from this. The movie dragssssssssssss in several places. I LOVED Fury Road. I was amazed how good a movie using ACTUAL people and cars for stunts looked. This movie just goes the same lazy route most big budget movies do now. Who cares how it looks, just get it on the screen.",3.0,29 May 2024
Best Mad Max so far,"Yeah, I've said it.

The classic ones were amazing.

Fury Road was and still is one of the best blockbusters of the previous decade.

Furiosa takes what Fury Road was and makes it even better. Visuals are still stunning. Road fights are even funnier, longer and more original than the Fury Road ones.

The world building is amazing- we get to see the same one than the previous movie but, this time, we have the chance to see and enjoy a couple of cities that were only mentioned before.

Now, besides comparisons- Furiosa is an epic standalone movie. You don't need to watch any other movie to understand it- the ending even connects you directly with the sequel, Fury Road.

And the cast! Chris Hemsworth does an incredible job as the villain. You can see the fun he's having playing him! And there's nothing that will remind you of Thor which is amazing.

Hands down to Anya as Furiosa though. She does make the character her own. She's outstanding as the centre of the story even when she doesn't have many lines- but her eyes, my God. How do the speak.

Go watch it. This is that kind of action packed ""you should watch this on the big screen"" kind of movie.",9.0,24 May 2024
The Organic Mechanic,"I was extremely skeptical of a prequel to Fury Road that didn't include Max. I went into the movie with low expectations and was truly blown away! The world of Fury Road is what got me into Mad Max... I loved it so much that I went back and watched all the originals with Mel Gibson and played the fantastic Warner Bros. Video game Mad Max (2015). I really wanted to give Furiosa a fair shake and I'm so glad I did! Miller does such a great job in the world-building department. Not only does he bring in locations and characters from the previous movies and games he also builds on it in meaningful ways. Sure one can argue that we didn't need this entry in the franchise, and honestly, I would agree. However, I'm glad to say we got it regardless. The combination of top-notch action scenes, immersive worldbuilding, and (surprisingly) airtight plot come together to make a truly great movie. I highly recommend this one to any Mad Max fan! Hopefully, it will hold us over until Mad Max: The Wasteland (2025)! I give Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga an 8.5 of out 10!",9.0,29 May 2024
Wonderful Experience!!,"As a fan of Mad Max Saga and George Miller who is very famous for portraying the wasteland stories, I was looking for this for a long time. Watched in IMAX on the second day with 80% audience and was a fabulous experience.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga follows the backstory of Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron in the legendary Mad Max: Fury Road. Alyla Browne played the young character and Anya Taylor-Joy played the young Furiosa. I should the say that casting was excellent coz both looks 99% similar. Alyla delivered a wonderful performance as her eyes speaks throughout the movie and was totally conveyed. Anya's action sequences as well as the performances were aboslutely wonderful and eye-catchy.

Chris Hemworth totally excelled in his role as Dementus. He was breathtaking with his scintillating performance as brutal protagonist. Tom Burke who played Jack, the driver was also good with his performance.

The narration of the movie was absolutely fascinating proving that the veteran George Miller has still got the gasolene in his petrol tank. It was fast, edge of the seat narration which will give goosebumps in several scenes. Tom Holkenborg's background score was perfect stich to the narration. The climax of the movie was quite dramatic but from my point of view it was a perfect one.

When compared to Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa stays next to the latter. But considering the nature of the movie, Furiosa as the revenge action thriller, satisfied me as a whole

Watch it in theaters.

Excellent start and great action 🎬🔥,"George Miller's ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is an exhilarating action film with an outstanding start and strong character development. Charlize Theron's performance as Furiosa is extraordinary, complemented by a standout role from Anya Taylor-Joy. The action sequences are spectacular, though some scenes have noticeable CGI. Despite this minor flaw, the film's compelling narrative, breathtaking cinematography, and thematic depth make it a must-watch for action fans. Miller has crafted another thrilling addition to the Mad Max universe. I highly recommend it; it stands strong alongside ""Mad Max: Fury Road.🎬🔥",10.0,28 May 2024
Furiosa missed the mark...,"First of all would someone care to explain me why George Miller went with spin off when he could've made an sequel to Mad Max Fury Road with Tom Hardy which fans are waiting to see since last few years... When Fury Road came in 2015 it was regarded as one of the best action film of all time and that was true, that movie had explosive action sequences.. Same thing was expected from this movie ( what else you expect from a Mad Max movie set in post apocalyptic world other than this. Lol), but it missed the mark.. Sure there are some action scenes but by the end of climax they all fade away.. It is the origin story of Furiosa as she was trying to get revenge of Dementeus for killing her mom but it lacked material to keep audience engaged in the story.. I don't know if audience wanted to see origin of Furiosa or not because she never looked as an appealing character to me ,they should've gone with Max's origin story before moving of sequel to 2015 film.. Anya Taylor Joy was good in her role, Chris Hemsworth is clown like he is in MCU these days he never looked like a real threat to me, action scenes were good but not amazing, climax is a total waste, if you are expecting an explosive final battle at the end you'll be highly disappointed.. Midway Highway battle sequence was only good scene in this movie.. Soundtrack by Junkie XL is the real MVP of this movie, cinematography and visuals will remind you of another masterpiece that released earlier this aka Dune 2...Overall film is neither good nor bad but it is enjoyable even though it looks overlong at some time..",6.0,24 May 2024
Begs to be seen in theaters,"Hello old friends. I just had to return to share my thoughts on what very well may be the best theatrical experience in years. I, like may, have shunned the cinema as of late. For one thing there just hasn't been anything playing that I cared to see. But I'd been looking forward to this one for some time now (nine years?). Even if the reviews had been bad I just had to see it for myself.

Well friends, it did not disappoint. What a ride! Like Fury Road, I expect it to lose some if its appeal when it leaves theaters and is relegated to the smaller screen. But that is exactly why you need to see it now! Some movies are better viewed at home, where it's quiet. Some are better viewed in theaters. This is a theater kind of movie if ever there was one!

A road less traveled...,"""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" Marks the return of legendary director's George Millers magnum opus film series. Although this time a prequel to the 2015 film ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Following protagonist Furiosa, we journey on a quest of ultimate revenge. A world building experience with some strong performances but ultimately pales in comparison to previous outings...but that's not a bad thing. Furiosa carves its own identity and place within the Mad Max lore. A decent opening to the summer film season that audiences should enjoy.

Positives: + Show stealing performance by Chris Hemsworth.

+ Builds the lore in the Mad Max Universe.

+ Keeps the simple storytelling mark as precious entries.

You're missing out on a lot if you choose not to watch it,"When last weekend's box office numbers came out, it was shocking to see how poor Furiosa's opening weekend performance was. I say 'shocking' in a more disappointing tone, because for all our complaining of mind numbing, formulaic and unoriginal trash, we seem to abandon the good ones when they do come out.

George Miller's ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is one of the year's stronger movies and definitely one that HAS TO BE WATCHED on the big screen. It is as gorgeous as it is a visual spectacle, and it's also just 150-minutes of pure adrenaline and mayhem. 150-minutes that I couldn't get enough of, especially given how one of my biggest cinema regrets has always been not watching its predecessor ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" in cinemas. Untouchable as ""Fury Road"" might be, ""Furiosa"" is as close as it gets, and in cinemas, it's more than what we paid for.

I'm not going to lie, that first trailer was anything but promising. It felt cheap, it felt fake and it felt like it exists simply to make a quick buck off of the success of Fury Road. But if I can convince you of anything, let it be to ignore the trailer and give this movie a chance. Not only for its high octane action, its amazing stunt work, its gorgeous cinematography that captures the barren wasteland in ways that might seem magical, but also for it being a well made, well written, well realized movie that can keep you entertained without a doubt.

It would be better if you were familiar with the Mad Max universe, especially ""Fury Road"" to which this movie is an immediate prequel, as it helps appreciate this movie for itself as well as for how well it fits into the universe, but this being your first Mad Max movie isn't a bad idea either. The premise and the concept could be a little jarring at first, but give it a chance and you'll grow to appreciate it!",9.0,29 May 2024
More CGI & less Practical Effects.,"Remember when Mad Max Fury Road came out and everyone was talking about how everything was almost completely clean with practical effects? Almost everything looked so damn realistic, the action, the camera works, the landscape, everything. But Furiosa is different. Some of the world's reviewers mentioned that not everyone who liked Fury Road was going to like this movie and we agreed. This, in particular is why; Furiosa was a toned down approach when it comes to practical effects. It isn't nearly as good as Fury Road. It loses 'that' thing that made Fury Road what some people might call a classic. If you're expecting everything practical, you're going to be disappointed.

What Furiosa offers is something else. And you need to be able to accept it before you can even start liking the film. While Fury Road is more grounded and raw, Furiosa feels like a dream-like reality. It is more CGI-ed, the texture is more artsy, and at times, you'd probably realize that it feels like the editors have painted it to look a bit more cartoony. There's nothing wrong here but when you have Fury Road that's just miles better, it's hard to for people not to compare to its predecessor.

But here comes one aspect that Furiosa aces more than Fury Road. It has a story to tell. An origin worth investing in. Fury Road lacks this part, it serves only the basic and the rest is action. Furiosa is more story and character-driven than action. From the moment it starts, you know this has a real weight put towards it. A lot of effort were put in the script. And yes, the story is interesting. We needed her origin because Fury Road didn't tell us much about her. How? Why? Who? A lot weren't explained so this prequel was made for that.

However, it just doesn't feel neat. The story starts off really good, the direction is clear. But as the movie progresses, it begins to crumble bit by bit. The pacing is uneven, the story sometimes loses its focus and at times, there are a lot of things going on, it feels a bit too crowded. But nowhere do we say that this movie is bad. It isn't bad but it could have been polished more.

And we were expecting more for the finale. It isn't grand enough. It isn't as emotional as how we expected. And it's even inconclusive. We understand that Furiosa's origin is a lore but the ending is kept open and loose. So your interpretation of 'that' one thing is kept ambiguous, letting you decide based on the character study you've seen for the past 2 hours. If you're expecting for an explosive grand finale, just don't because it's not going to give you that. It's more personal. It's more centred on the characters' emotions and motivations rather than an action-packed climax.

And let's not forget Anya Taylor-Joy, she's just so good in this role. You can see the resemblance with Charlize Theron with how she brings her character to life. She's gritty. Furiosa is someone who follows that 'revenge is a dish best served cold' handbook and Anya nails it in her role. Chris Hemsworth also looks and acts very differently than his previous roles. He's selfish, menacing, mischievous in his own unique ways. Kudos to him and the makeup team.

Verdict: Critics were right. Not everyone who loves Mad Max: Fury Road is going to love Furiosa, and we know exactly why. Furiosa takes a toned-down approach, using fewer practical effects and relying more on CGI, creating dream-like, fantasy landscapes that look like a beautiful canvas. While it excels in storytelling and character development, the film suffers from uneven pacing and a bland finale, which is completely opposite to what Fury Road offered almost a decade ago. Nevertheless, Furiosa is still worth watching for die-hard action movie fans, or at least for Anya Taylor-Joy.",6.0,26 May 2024
Disappointed,"To those of you giving this movie high marks, I'm not sure I was watching the same movie.

Typical Australian melodramatic badly acted movie, HOWEVER before the hate mongerers chime in, let me explain. I liked the original Mad Max because it was ground breaking for its time, even though also a badly acted b-movie, it was kitschy enough to be entertaining and Mel Gibson had the intensity and character backstory to make it work, vengeance, and good versus evil, cop versus bad guys; and I also LOVED Mad Max: Fury Road but then Charlize Theron and the story line all worked, she was cast perfectly and carried the movie.

Even Chris Hemsworth couldn't save this, it was like the terrain thoughout, dusty and dry, no connection established with the characters, even Furiosa, confusing storyline with obvious flaws in the continuity, and immensley overacted. And Hemsworth's black humor written into the dialogue fell flat with this watcher, it felt bland and forced and not fitting with his character.

If you like rat rods and trucks, bang sticks, dangerous stunts (AI, CG), nonstop explosions, and nothing to challenge you mentally, then you'll like this movie but I give it an ""F"" even though I will tell you I went in with high hopes and really wanted to like it. I stayed to the end only because I kept waiting for it to get better, but in the end the only redeeming value for me was I had a voucher for a free ticket... but wish now I hadn't wasted it.

I haven't seen Chris Hemsworth in many movies so had low hopes for him but he actually was really good in this movie. I had no surprises about Anya's excellent performance.

I liked that it went from slow to fast and back. It was good to get more background knowledge and insight into characters rather than just action action action. I am a fan of the new Mad Maxs and haven't delved into the older ones but I'll show up for any Mad Max in the future.",9.0,29 May 2024
"As Perfect As Fury Road, and Technically Way More Creative","Tremendous cast, numerous action-packed scenes. The duration of the picture and the scenes reminds us again of what kind of a world of craziness and insanity that Mad Max universe is full of. From tip to toe, from every major character to minor character, nearly nobody has a clear mind to think reasonably. Every character makes a move with its instincts.

Even though Anya Taylor-Joy had merely few lines throughout the two and a half hours long movie, her mimics(especially facial expressions) and gestures were spectacular enough to show every kind of emotion Furiosa feels at the moment, which evidently proves and accentuates her broad acting skills and her being the right choice to portray Furiosa who is a character possessor of profound thoughts. Besides, she tries very hard to avoid the traumas in the past she had that left scars on her body and on her soul. That factor makes her the same as Chris's character.

This might be Chris Hemsworth's most powerful acting performance as well which is worthy of the entire Thor performances of his made the character look as relentless, as mad as the other characters. His character was driven by sorrow and the despair of never being able to adjusting his past, so basically he's a guy trying escaping from his past but never feels satisfied no matter what he does. This is why this character is going to be known as one of the most remarkable antagonists in cinema history.

Some of the noticeable Fury Road cast members reprised their roles in it, but in this one they are more likely to be anti-heroic rather than antagonists.

Maybe not as emotionally-hitting as Fury Road, yet impressive in its own way. Don't miss this one!",9.0,24 May 2024
A great movie that sets the bar for prequels,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" (2024) is a masterful sequel, or in this case, a prequel movie. This is a prequel story to the arguably best action film that graced the screens since 2015. To top or at least to be equally good to ""Fury Road"" was almost impossible task. After returning from screening of ""Furiosa"" i can only say that this movie is on the same level as ""Fury Road"" - for me personally. If there will be a better film in summer season of 2024, its going to be one exceptional summer.

""Furiosa"" is a great action, adventure movie that works on almost every level. Director George Miller is a true star of this film, and you can clearly see a vision that come a live and a filmmaker doing great job in a universe he has created it. At running time 2 h 28 min never was i bored or not entertained by this stunning cinema. Action scenes, while related this time more on a CGI, are incredible to say the least. Cinematography is so sharply clear that you can understand, see and almost feel the action on screen. I do wish more screentime would have been given to some of the characters, but at the end of the day this is a ""Mad Max Saga"" - so you know what you are in for.

Overall, ""Furiosa"" is a terrific movie in every way. Two lead actors did a wonderful job, and they were as good as they ever were before. But its director and craftsmanship who were real starts of ""Furiosa"". If you loved ""Fury Road"", you will love ""Furiosa"". Its one of the very best prequels ever made.",10.0,24 May 2024
What it could have been,"Overly long, bad cgi and a story that's is very incoherent. This movie definitely missed the mark big time. Many scene could have been cut/shortened. The fact that the abundance of cgi was used is criminal. Anna was ok and Chris was fine, but nothing major or stand out. The jumps between time are jarring, and not made clear Untill some dialogue is spoken later on. It could have been so much more. And also the wait the fans had a think, made the hype for it all die down to much.

This could have been titled anything else, as there is not much to tie it to the mad max, apart from imortan Joe. Let's leave this series alone now. And just have mad max fury road as the crown jewel.",6.0,1 June 2024
A spectacle of hellish visions,"Looking back at George Miller's monumental ""Furiosa"", I realize that it's far from perfect. The plot can be chaotic, with a few gaps here and there, the chemistry between Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her mentor and confidant Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke) is rushed and artificial. Some of you who've seen 2015's ""Fury Road"" could even argue that the action scenes lost some of their charm due to more intensive usage of CGI here. But this is just the plot. And while its the chunkiest part of any movie, it's still not the whole. There is a space in which the rest of what makes a movie is found. And is in that space that greatness is often done.

Here, director George Miller--now close to 80 years old--uses that place to give the kind of spiritual weight unexpected from a blockbuster movie by employing hellish visions that transform the post-apocalyptic Australian desert landscape of ""Furiosa"" in an entire otherworldly realm. The movie is filled with shots resembling Christian iconography, ancient mythology and the kind of visual set-pieces straight out from Hieronymus Bosch's disturbing paintings of hell. Sure, they are not the main course, but they give the movie its own theological weight, and completely transform the way in which George Miller feels about his universe 45 years in the making.. and perhaps about himself.

People tend to change their life philosophy as they get older and filmmakers are no different. Maybe these are just ideas that I'm bringing to him, but looking back on an explosive career, Miller hopes there is also things to look forward to as well even now. Like Furiosa, who is kept strong by the hope of the Green Place she prays to return to one day, Miller also hopes that there is still more to the bulk of his life. But he also understands the cleansing power of pain. I understand now why his characters are broken and suffering. The post-apocalyptic world they inhabit is part of their own past misjudgments so now they must suffer for it.

A great character for this pathology is Chris Hemsworth's villainous Dementus. Hemsworth gives the performance of a lifetime as the dark, twisted and disturbingly cartoonish messianic leader of a desert gang as he buts head with the equally cruel Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme) and Furiosa herself and has lost all sense of morality caring for nothing but power. That is because, unlike Furiosa, he has lost hope. His broken body, however, bears signs of better times. He has a teddy bear, for instance, that he always wears on his person which belonged to his daughter. He is the best thing in the entire movie.

But maybe you don't care about any of that. Maybe you just want to be entertained. And why wouldn't you? After all ""do you have the power to make it epic?"" asks Dementus at one point in the movie. Then know that ""Furiosa"" still delivers on that front. The plot, while not perfect, is extremely eventful; the action is overwhelming; Tom Holkenborg's score is all-consuming; and Anya Taylor-Joy as the silent and calculated Furiosa is one of the greatest female protagonists in cinema history.",10.0,31 May 2024

Furiously Fantastc!!,"Furiosa is damn near a perfect film. Top tier storytelling, casting, acting, directing, cinematography, special effects, stunts, lighting, vehicles, firearms, sound, setting, and pace. Furiosa's origin story is magnificent in its originality and complexity. Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth were magnificent.

The stunts, while not as insane and jaw dropping as Fury Road, were still bloody fantastic. The only thing I could ding Furiosa for was the ultra clean windshields of the vehicles. They were missing the grime, grease, and dust of other Mad Max films.

Not a dull moment in this epic story and a worthy addition to the marvelously unique Mad Max world. Five stars!!",10.0,29 May 2024

A bonkers experience,"'Furiosa A mad max Saga' is a worthy prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road. The Grisly Horror of man kind in wasteland, the chaos, Filthy and greedy world of a dystopian future is done again brilliantly.

George Miller at the age of 79 made a movie with outstanding action sequences, fast pacing chase scene with a great story and screenplay.

Anya Taylor-Joy portrayed Furiosa character with such a great conviction, same as Charlize Theron did in Mad Max Fury Road.

Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was Fantastic. Such a charismatic performance. This must be the best performance in his career.

The phenomenal Visual effects, production design, Sound design and sound Effects makes it a memorable experience.

The sound design in Dolby Atmos of this movie is Demo Worthy.

Furiosa stands as one of the brilliantly executed action movie of this year without a doubt.

Can't wait to see it again in IMAX.",9.0,1 June 2024
You fabulous thing.,"Although it's aesthetically similar to 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)', 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)' is a different beast entirely when it comes to its narrative. Structurally, tonally and even viscerally distinct from its predecessor, this revenge epic has a much less frenetic atmosphere than you may expect. At times, it's almost serene. With an episodic format that splits the story into vignettes (more so than even its five chapter breaks would suggest), the feature depicts the origin of its eponymous badass while also widening the world that surrounds her. Indeed, much of the movie is dedicated to world building rather than propulsive action, but that's not to imply that there are a lack of set-pieces. In fact, pretty much the whole movie is a set-piece; even the simplest of lore-extending scenarios are told with such striking visual grandeur that you'll practically be drooling for the film's entire duration. Plus, there are several more traditional yet utterly jaw-dropping action scenes - including a meticulous fifteen-minute War Rig defence that may just be the movie's highlight. It's difficult to describe how epic even the most intimate moments of the affair feel, and the budget has been put to fantastic use to set this relatively small-stakes story amidst a backdrop of bizarre post-apocalyptic societies and ruthless wasteland power struggles. There's so much depth to each and every aspect here, and most of it is conveyed entirely visually (Furiosa herself probably only has about the same amount of dialogue as the notoriously quiet protagonist of 'Mad Max 2 (1981)'). Anya Taylor-Joy brings a palpable determination to the role, her eyes telling a story of long-burning pain and quiet desperation, and Alyla Browne holds her own as the younger version of the character (the transition between the two actors is so seamless it's hard to actually pinpoint the exact moment it occurs*). The most showy role in the flick definitely goes to Chris Hemsworth, whose Dr. Dementus is a verbose maniac with just enough depth and charisma that his evil nature is almost too easy to downplay - especially in a world in which decency seems to have died a long time ago. He's a really entertaining villain, and it's enjoyable to see a new faction in the wasteland rather than just expanding on the one we've seen before (Immortan Joe and his blindly loyal War Boys). While I personally don't think it drags or anything, the movie is arguably a little too long. However, it's also arguably too short. It kind of acts as a 'greatest hits' of its hero's life, starting when she's a child and finishing just before her actions at the beginning of 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)'. As such, there's a lot of stuff that gets glossed over - or, rather, skipped entirely - so that the movie can maintain its purposefully elliptical pacing. A lot of the stuff that it moves past feels like it would be really interesting, so I kind of wish it was fleshed out more and maybe the film was done as a two-parter. I know that's technically a criticism, but it's also kind of a compliment. After all, it's not often you wish a picture was longer, let alone split into two parts, which should indicate just how successful George Miller's effort is. The feature truly is spectacular, an exceptional epic with almost unparalleled aesthetic beauty and pristine direction of the highest order. It's wonderfully weird for a blockbuster, and I really hope it does well enough for Warner Bros. To greenlight another trip to the wasteland. While I don't like it as much as 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)', it's just as sturdy and substantial. Because it's so different, it doesn't even require a direct comparison. It's great.

*the use of AI to achieve this effect is somewhat disturbing, but it's unclear exactly how the tool was used (i.e. To help a human artist or to replace one) so I'm not confident in fully condemning it just yet.",8.0,30 May 2024
Furiousa's complexity outdoes Fury Road's two-dimensions,,10.0,2 June 2024
"""I hold him profoundly in contempt""","I quite enjoyed it! The story is a very interesting chapter in Immortan Joe's difficult reign! With survival and leadership amidst a landscape filled with covetous and ambitious individuals vying for power.

Fury Road's cinematic and chaotic style catered well to general audiences and garnered significant word of mouth. But it was relentless! Furiosa, on the other hand, seems to lack that same impact (which might affect its box office performance).. but is not a detriment! This installment felt more in line with the latter two movies of the original trilogy, and the world building is satisfying.

Still, I do think Anya Taylor-Joy's portrayal felt ""too childish"" for the role (even at the end). While she is usually quite charming, she doesn't physically embody Furiosa, especially when considering the direct connection to the Fury Road version. The lack of dialogue and presence further detracted from her performance. Chris delivered a very memorable character despite being somewhat tame compared to my expectations. But he fits perfectly. Tom Burke's Praetor Jack stood out as my favorite character, reminiscent of Iroquois Pliskin. Lastly, the CGI appeared under-polished, suggesting either a reduced budget or a rushed production.

Be it the impact of grandiose set-pieces or over the top and fresh world-building, or a lack of more memorable characters (what we did get felt like a glimpse of MGS villains, but with little screen time).. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it is lacking something.

Easily recommended.",7.0,28 May 2024
Beautifully Made Film,"George Miller and his team have created another great addition to the Mad Max series of films with Furiosa. It's a prequel to Fury Road telling the story of how Furiosa came of age and became the person she was in Fury Road. I really enjoyed the artful storytelling that was created in this movie. The characters were also really well done, though at times I felt like Chris Hemsworth was too much Thor. Anya Taylor-Joy was fantastic as Furiosa. I liked Charlize Theron better because I felt like she was physically tougher, but Anya played the part really well and brought her own style to it. She did really well at bridging Furiosa as a little girl to become the hard-core wasteland warrior.

All that said, I do think the movie could have benefitted from some more dialogue to tell the story a bit more clearly, tie together events better, etc. And maybe also tighter editing. Some scenes were just confusing on how the characters got there or why they were happening. The visuals and sound are amazing in this movie, but it could have used a little less show and a little more tell. Overall, though, if you liked Fury Road, I think you will like this one, maybe not as much, but certainly well. I highly recommend it!",8.0,31 May 2024
Wasteland Warrior: The Redux,"Though a cohesive story from George Miller, the revenge story of Furiosa was good, but it felt like it needed to be made more for episodic television with its 5 chapters within a 2.5 hour movie. Anya Taylor Joy did a great job as Furiosa, but Chris Hemsworth stole the show as Dementus. The only drawback I have with this movie is that it relied to much on CGI whereas Fury Road did primarily practical effects which made it special. Overall a great action movie with some new characters (and some added from a connected story with the Mad Max video game) but overall a good story. Just feels like it would have been better suited for episodic rather than one movie.",7.0,29 May 2024
An excellent prequel and decent origin story.,"One of the most anticipated films of the year fulfilled its objective of having quality and character from the vision of an excellent director such as George Miller in the world of Mad Max.

Furiosa had an excellent handling of the main actors such as Chris Hemsworth in his role as Dementus, releasing and transmitting the personality of a dangerous, crazy and obviously ""insane"" being, he stands out as an honorable villain next to Immortal Joe.

And to top it off, the fabulous and talented Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa, steals the entire movie with her fantastic performance from the perception of a woman who is flooded with vengeance and anger from her facial expressions and the reduction of extensive dialogue, being one of the actress's best performances to date.

The story can be a little slow, especially the beginning, but after the first few minutes it begins to take on an adrenaline pace and engages the audience. It complements the post-apocalyptic scenarios along with excellent handling of the visual effects, it has photography and amazing montage.

It will not be a perfect film, but it will faithfully represent the essence of the Mad Max saga, the origin of the character of Furiosa, and with audiovisual elements that both fans and the general audience can enjoy, represented from originality. 9/10.",9.0,2 June 2024
Hemsworth is the reason to watch.,"Not a bad flick, Chris steals every scene and makes you look forward to the next time he's on. The best scenes with ATJ were her partnership with. Tom Burke who had a fantastic Aussie accent. Unfortunately ATJ fell flat when she stole Sigourney's haircut from Alien Resurrection and the T1000s arm, then the audience has to suffer with Hemsworth the indignity of being beaten up by this pint size Ripley Lobster. Sad to watch.

The action is enjoyable, especially in the current climate where films like these are few and far between. Fingers crossed that one day they beg Mel Gibson to reprise the role one last time.",6.0,29 May 2024
Anya was a bad choice,"Furiosa"" had the potential to be a thrilling prequel to ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but it falls short mainly due to the miscasting of the lead role. Charlize Theron, who originally portrayed Furiosa, brought unmatched intensity and depth to the character. Replacing her with Anya Taylor-Joy was a risky decision that didn't pay off.

Taylor-Joy fails to capture the tough, battle-hardened essence of Furiosa. Her performance feels more like posing than genuine acting, and her widely set eyes are distracting, taking away from her ability to portray a seasoned warrior convincingly.

The film shines in other areas with a strong supporting cast and stunning action sequences that maintain the chaotic energy of the franchise. The cinematography and world-building are immersive, drawing viewers into the dystopian wasteland. However, without a compelling lead, the narrative struggles to gain traction.

""Furiosa"" hints at greatness with its intriguing plot elements and commendable supporting performances, but the decision to cast Taylor-Joy overshadows these positives. The film feels like a missed opportunity, as it could have soared with Charlize Theron reprising her iconic role.

In conclusion, ""Furiosa"" is a mixed bag. It has the potential of a great action film but falters in execution due to a central performance that doesn't hit the mark. Fans are left wondering what could have been if Theron had returned as the lead.",4.0,28 May 2024
Outstanding,"It is a complete action pack with a griping story.

Direction was epic and Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris were phenomenal in their characters.

It is all you hope for action and an adventure movie. I am an old fan of this franchise.

I played the game Mad Max so had the better understanding of the locations like Gastown, Bullitt Farm.

This movie gave you all you want to know how Furiso came to work under the immortal joe and what make her to flew with the War machine along with the wives. But the thing is i liked the War machine showed in this movie. It was way more lethal than we already saw in the Fury Road.

I am really excited to hope more of this kind of stuff to watch. I am still waiting for Max to come back.",10.0,29 May 2024
Non Stop Action,"Furiosa is pure action from start to finish. George Miller have done it with Fury Road and he did again, it's amazing to see a director who is almost 80 still get to do these epic action movie. Visually the movie looks stunning in every frame, especially when depicting the antagonist, the use of vibrant color makes some scenes stick with you, like the scene with Chris Hemsworth in red with orange background.

The cast was really memorable, specially Chris Hemsworth playing Dementus, you can see how much fun he was having while playing the villain role here, he was so detestable but pretty clever, always skimming, the best kind of villain. Anja Taylor-Joy was also great, she was not in the movie as much as I thought but she was still very bad ass in almost every scene she was in.

The movie was split into chapters or acts, it was like watching a season of TV show. I felt thorn on this, it did give you a theme of the chapter, like a tease of what to come, but I felt like it made the movie less connected. I wasn't sure if it should be there or maybe the movie would have been slightly better without it. Just a small knit pick though. The movie is still really good. 9/10.",9.0,30 May 2024
A world unlike anything else,"I have never taken substances, but I imagine this is what being high af feels like.

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) is one of the greatest films ever made, that left such a significant cultural impact kudos to its unapologetic uniqueness, it's as if the franchise had created its own sub-genre in action filmmaking, and I'm happy to say that Furiosa is a more than worthy successor to its legacy.

For me, action filmmaking is like a relationship. One between the audience and the director. At the start of an action sequence, the director invites you to surrender yourself and embark on a journey-a journey greater than yourself, where you feel insignificant and minuscule. It takes a lot of courage for us egotistic beings to conciously surrender ourselves to that kind of control, and for that, you need to trust you're in good hands, and there's no safer pair than George Miller's.

Only George Miller could craft such a viceral cinematic experience, which is yet so profound. You'll pay for the full seat, but you'll only need the edge of it. Every frame of this film pulsates with adrenaline. The action sequences and camera choreography are so innovative, they defy belief, making you wonder how a group of humans could achieve such imagery.

Furiosa is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. Any amount of money you spend on this is worth it. If possible, experience it in IMAX to fully immerse yourself in its grandeur.",10.0,31 May 2024
A kinetic synergy of style with substance,"All the things that could have gone wrong with this film (prequel, re-casting etc) thankfully work out amazingly well. George Miller is a master storyteller, he is like a rock opera orchestrator of motion pictures. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in this film that serves style over substance (ie story). It is an action movie but its language harkens back to master storytellers (Buster Keaton and Kurosawa in particular), who knew that everything within a frame and especially movement, is paet of the visual vocabulary of the film. The themes are epic, timeless and archetypal as well as personal, contemporary and quite often political, all at the same time. But, first and foremost, this is a visual feast, one that comes once in a decade (if we are lucky) with the complexity of a (post) modern graphic novel.",10.0,29 May 2024
"""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a decent movie but not incredible.","""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a good film but it fails to live up to ""Mad Max"", ""Mad Max 2"" or ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", this new installment is somewhat simplistic and repetitive, falling at the level of the third part: ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"". The script that serves as a prequel and spin-off of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" manages to have good moments but falls far behind in the action of the previous film. The cinematography is nothing special, although it manages to stand out in some scenes, the soundtrack composed for the film goes unnoticed and the editing work does not achieve anything new. For their part, the special effects in the action scenes are achieved, although they feel common and taken as a tribute to the third film in the saga. Anya Taylor-Joy achieves a good performance in the dramatic scenes but in the action scenes she barely manages to interpret epic moments, her performance does not reach that of Charlize Theron as Furiosa. Chris Hemsworth, for his part, makes a good but not spectacular villain, since the comic tone he gives to his character lowers its intensity. Charlee Fraser in her few minutes on screen, manages to provide the best performance of the cast. Director George Miller still has the touch, but in this installment he fell short. ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a decent movie but not incredible.",6.0,29 May 2024
One of the best prequels ever made,"You might be thinking that Furiosa is an unnecessary prequel to an awesome film and I would have agreed with you but after watching it the movie is amazing and it's a really good time. The trailers do not do it justice and if you're at all a fan of the Mad Max movies especially Mad Max: Fury Road you should definitely watch it. It adds to the Mad Max lore quite a bit and makes the world feel more interesting. If you're a fan of Anya Taylor Joy, she's pretty great in this movie and if you aren't, she's only in the movie for less than half of the runtime. Either way Anya Taylor Joy as Furiosa is not the most interesting about Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, it is the amazing world that she has to survive.

The reality is that if we want to see more of the world and the next Mad Max movie starring Tom Hardy, more people have to go and watch this one and if they do they won't be disappointed.",,30 May 2024
One of the best IMAX experiences ever - Deserves high ratings!,"I'm not sure why the ratings lowered from when they became available I remember them being at least 8.7 a week ago don't know how anyone saw early I would've if I had a way. To me the movie was an electrifying thrill ride with fantastic storytelling, perfect directing of all the action by visionary George Miller so glad he's directed all the films, superb dialogue, and all around exciting truly hope more appreciate than not! Chris Hemsworth should win awards, it's good that Anya Taylor Joy has won awards she's a talented actress. I imagine this was in devolvement for a long time the details were superb. Fury Road won a bunch of Oscar's between this and Dune Part 2 are top contenders of best action experiences of the year.",10.0,24 May 2024
Not nearly as great as Fury,"Being the prequel to one of the best action movies ever made is a burden. This movie is pretty good, but it's not Fury Road (""FR""). Seeing the genus of characters from FR is fun. The action scenes are fun and full of tension. The effects are generally well done.

Alyla Browne is really good as young Furiosa. Hemsworth is terrific as Dementus, who kind of outshines Anya Taylor-Joy. Dementus is much more flamboyant character. Furiosa emotionally is not that exciting. ATJ looks great. It's not her, it's the way the character is written.

If this movie has been made first, it would have had more excitement. But that's not what happened here. Still, I enjoyed it.",7.0,26 May 2024
The difference is night and day,"This is not a Mad Max movie. And this is not the ''Fury Road'' prequel you would expected.

Taylor's part start, it kinda starts to become a little more bearable. But it still is comedic, zero serious, zero madness and almost zero cool things happening around the world.

Chris Hemsworth is captivating as dementus, an all out villain with 0 morals or empathy. Many recognisable faces from fury road which all enhance both this story and the previous film

Please support this film. We need more like it.",9.0,26 May 2024
Sound and visual storytelling was Bombastic yet with some flaws,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) is a visually striking film, structured explicitly into five parts. The world-building mirrors Dune, yet with a more humanistic twist involving tribes and a desperate need for oil and gas.

The dynamic cinematography effectively scales from intimate close-ups to grand, massive landscapes, particularly the stunning sand dunes. The stunts are hyper-real and dangerous, showcasing impressive acting and camerawork. The night scenes are uniquely well-lit. While most costume designs are impressive, some appear visually cheap. The villains, although looking clumsy and arrogant, work well within the film's context.

The sound mixing is phenomenal and the soundtrack by Junkie XL felt distinctively influenced by Hans Zimmer. The music, with layered brass and violin orchestras, perfectly complements the sound design, creating a very loud and immersive ""wow""-type experience.

Regarding editing choices, while the time-lapse editing helps clarify the timeline, the second time-lapse was unnecessary and seemed odd. Moreover, all over the movie the unnecessary speed-ups felt awkward and detracted from the natural flow. Some scenes were unnecessarily long, and the editor could have made more consistent cuts to improve pacing.

The second act, though chaotic, was visually engaging. Some CGI moments appeared cheap, but the overall world-building is unique and compelling. The writing improves in the second act compared to the first. Actor's voice depth is notable but for some not profound enough. The third act's action scenes are the most enjoyable and visually engaging. However, again, the frequent speed-ups detracted from my overall enjoyment. The fourth and fifth act is full of tension and suspense. The main villain has a vibe reminiscent of The Dark Knight's Joker, and the revenge theme, though messy, adds to the film's fun.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga offers a visually dynamic experience with impressive world-building and intense action scenes. Despite that there are gaps in the pacing and unnecessary scenes, but the fifth act is full of tension and suspense, its unique storytelling and compelling visuals make it a solid 8/10, and a very decent 9/10 for its thrilling moments and creative execution.",8.0,25 May 2024
Ride of a Mad Man,"Furiosa is an engine that starts slow but strong, until it accelerates to one of the most muscular movies I've seen. The difference between this movie and an engine is that an engine runs out of gas. By the time Furiosa ended I could've gone for another hour.

The opening 40 minutes (or was it an hour; I lost track of time) concerns Furiousa's childhood, establishing the backbone of a more complex entry than Fury Road. While the 2015 film is a giant chase of alliances and enemies, Furiosa is a more ambitious piece of work, even if that means less audacious action scenes. (But comparing the action of Furiosa to that of Fury Road is like comparing Central Park Tower to the Burj Khalifa; they both stand tall is what matters) It touches on the subtext of generational trauma that merges into pure feminine rage from Furiosa's adolescence to maturity. It also serves as an alternate coming-of-age movie; at the start Furiosa sees a brutal murder of a loved one, and at the end it pays off beautifully. Meanwhile we watch Chris Hemsworth, who seemed to collect all the resentment he got from playing a hero into one maniacal performance.

Strufturally Furiosa is similar to the 1979 original: More deep dives into the villains, more leather jackets, more empty roads. There's a long shot of Furiosa alone in the middle of nowhere after a long battle. She looks around, she breathes, she limps. Miller expands a badass heroine into someone we identify with.

Cars crash into and out of gates, into motobikes and eventually crashed by them. Far beyond the layers of rubble and explosions, it is the close-ups of Anya-Taylor Joy that is the most breathtaking. History will mention her in the same sentence as the greatest of action heroines. Behind the camera is the true auteur who embraces digital photography to create a product so uniquely dazzling. George Miller is a mad man, and action cinema is all the better for it.",9.0,25 May 2024
Great Action Movie,"I just watched this movie, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. The film is packed with exhilarating action sequences that are exceptionally well choreographed. From start to finish, the action is relentless and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

What really stood out for me was the solid story that perfectly complements the high-octane action. Also the movie has amazing visuals. The plot is engaging and well-developed, providing a strong foundation for the impressive visuals and stunts.

In comparison to the last installment, this movie is a significant improvement in every aspect. The narrative is tighter, the characters are more fleshed out, and the action scenes are more spectacular.

Overall, I believe this is one of the best movies to come out this year, right up there with Dune 2. If you're a fan of action-packed films with a compelling story, this is a must-watch!",10.0,22 May 2024
mixxed feelings but worth a watch,Action was good acting was good by most... its not as good as fury road i felt. And def doesnt touch any of the old films. Was a fun ride though. My biggest grip and many will disagree with me was Hemsworth.. it just felt like him playing thor playing his corny always the same character.. i dont find very fun to watch. His accent sounded scottish then brittish then thor lol. Was distracting for me. The other actors and actresses i think did a great job. Just could have done with less of this new hollywood goofball type of acting. Didnt fit the movie to me at all. Even kinda dressed him like thor.. cape n all lol. Anyway.. was still worth watching. Almost a 6 but the other people did so well i couldnt hit the 6 stars.,7.0,30 May 2024
An epic prequel to the original and a great origin story,"This was indeed an epic prequel and a great origin story about Furiosa from the original movie. Chris Hemsworth was fantastic as Dr. Dementis in this too. He was on a role with his part in the film. His character was like an anti-Thor and I still wish he would return as Thor in the MCU, even though that last Thor movie wasn't that good. This movie also had a lot more background about what was in the wastelands of Australia which was exactly how it looked after the apocalypse. Also the vehicles and action in this was awesome too and it would be nice to see some of those vehicles in real life out on highways. Great origin story and great prequel here. Ten out of ten.",10.0,25 May 2024
Furiosa,"Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most exhilarating and simply one of the greatest action films of all time. So going into Furiosa I was really excited for it. While that excitement of the first film wasn't met, the style was there in spades. The two films look very similar and that style is beautiful to look at and takes this film where it wouldn't have gone otherwise.

While the film looks beautiful because the cinematography, it is quite boring because of the pacing of the screenplay. Scenes in this film seem to not know when to end. Dementus (Chris Hemsworth giving one of his best performances) will stop his dialogue and the scene should cut, instead it drags on for another pointless 1-2 minutes to show us nothing. The film could've easily been edited down to at least 2 hours.

While I thought Chris Hemsworth was fantastic, I didn't feel the same of Anya-Taylor Joy. She is a fantastic actor and she's just ok in this. Hemsworth clearly steals the film.

I never thought that this would live up to the greatness of Fury Road but my hope was that it would at least give a similar exciting experience. This is nothing like Fury Road other than the cinematography. So if you go into this film thinking that you'll be slightly disappointed. While I liked this film I couldn't help but be disappointed by the final result. Enjoy it for the style and a crazy Chris Hemsworth.",6.0,31 May 2024
Another masterfully crafted journey through The Wasteland,"With the full-throttle energy and pacing that fueled Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa blazes through its 2.5-hour runtime to give us the kind of breath-taking epic we have long awaited.

The action sequences are simply spectacular, from the picture & sound editing to all the little intense choreographed moments sprinkled in like Furiosa tilting her gun to look at it after she pulls the trigger on empty. There ARE some moments with noticeable CGI or green screen, which is a problem that Fury Road did not have (it used some but it was never noticeable).

I was excited to hear the ""Brothers in Arms"" track make a return briefly from Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg), but tbh his score here is not as good as it was for Fury Road.

Anya Taylor Joy does a marvelous job, especially as the film goes on. The child actor Alyla Brown nails the Furiosa look and more than earns her role with the performance she gives. Child actors are just on another level nowadays. I don't think audiences appreciate just how terrible kids acting used to be in movies lol.

Chris Hemsworth's Dementus is wonderfully over the top and he does a fine job hitting his marks, with solid delivery and, more importantly, no cringe. :) It is also balanced well with the seriousness of the fabulous performance from Lachy Hulme as Immortan Joe (RIP Hugh Keays-Byrne). Tom Burke-who is not Bam Margera as my friend led me to believe during the film-I do wish more was done with this character and his influence on Furiosa.

On that note, the story does leave you feeling like wanting more, as it is very clearly an origin story. And this is not something I was ever left feeling after the first one. It's not that I expected more story... I really didn't. It's just the way the film introduces these compelling threads then doesn't follow any of them.

I remember reading about how for Fury Road, George Miller kept these elaborate profiles for each and every character, no matter how big or small to the story, to keep them genuine in the actors' minds and creating this thoroughly thought-out fictional world of the Wasteland. Perhaps that richness is best left in between the lines here as well, as it's tough to say it would have been advisable to mess with his impeccable pacing-the film's greatest strength.

With the bar being set at perfection, Furiosa is still a great action film and worthy prequel to Fury Road. There is a LOT to love about this product of master craftsmanship from the uniquely talented & visionary George Miller.",9.0,24 May 2024
A let down after watching Fury Road,"Fury Road killed it in every way. Furiosa was by no means a bad movie but relatively it was very slow. Also there was no build up to a huge climactic finale. The last quarter was too dialogue heavy and never had that big payoff you're hoping for. Good, not great.

This paragraph is just to make my review long enough for the new six hundred character requirement instituted because Amazon's $1Billion snow ranked and got bombed on this site. Hopefully they change it back because this is a waste of my and everyone else's time for quite literally seemingly absolutely no reason. Boom six hundred characters.",7.0,24 May 2024
I didnt expect anything yet still bad,,1.0,28 May 2024
Almost as good as Fury Road,"Before heading to the cinema to watch Furiosa, I revisited Fury Road. Just as in 2015, I rated it a perfect 10.

Naturally, I had high hopes for its prequel, Furiosa.

These hopes were nearly fulfilled. The cinematography, with its rapid cuts that I loved in Fury Road, is brilliantly replicated in Furiosa. The production design, including the wildly creative vehicles, is just as impressive. The score is similarly outstanding, and the acting is top-notch, with notable performances by the talented child actor Alyla Browne, the furious Anya Taylor-Joy, and the wild Chris Hemsworth. Honestly, the CGI that some critics mentioned didn't bother me at all!

The only reason I'm giving Furiosa a 9 instead of a 10 is due to its story. It's darker and more brutal than Fury Road, which I enjoyed. However, it delves deeper into the world of Mad Max and spans across 15 years, unlike Fury Road, which focuses on one intense chase. I preferred the story of Fury Road because it offered fewer details about the world, making it feel more mysterious and immersive. The single, continuous chase made the narrative more dynamic and intense.

Nevertheless, I love Furiosa and will certainly watch it again. Hence, the excellent rating of 9.",9.0,26 May 2024
Furiosa is a GREAT action movie!,"Furiosa is a tale of revenge, set in the Wastelands of the Mad Max Universe. (Possibly a rebooted Mad Max Universe.) Our main hero is a young girl who is taken from her people by a gang of thugs, and the first hour of this epic film tells the story of that young girl and the attempts by her loved ones to rescue her.

She ends up being traded to the villains from the Fury Road in return for land and oil, and the rest of the film we see how she she grows up into the ass-kicker with one mechanical arm we see when Max meets her later on.

The battle scenes in this movie are extraordinary. One in particular amazing sequence is where Furiosa is a stowaway on an oil rig and she helps her people (and a strong male ally who is sort of like Max) fight marauders. Holy smokes! What a fight scene.

This film is a prequel to Fury Road, but it is also in many ways its own story. And it's quite the saga.

Definitely, do not listen to people who throw shade at this film. I'm not even a big Fury Road fan, and this film isn't perfect, but it continues the legacy of emotional storytelling, great world building, compelling characters, and the most insanely high quality road war scenes...ever. Seriously, even the minor characters all feel fully fleshed out with story.

Some people say the CGI threw them, but I saw this in IMAX and I thought it was fine. Had no problem with it. I definitely hope they make more Mad Max movies.",8.0,26 May 2024
Just bloody beautiful. George Miller's vision is incomparable. [+81%],"Mad Max is a 45-year-old franchise, can you believe it? Here we are, in 2024, still looking forward to George Miller's new and improved takes on the Wasteland, especially after 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Now, that film redefined the action genre (for a lot of us), and with its incredible dystopian setting, it paved the way for some of the most iconic set-pieces to ever make it to the big screen. Furiosa is quintessentially an origin story, and it sticks to being a straightforward revenge parable rather than a character case study. That makes sense, because although the film feels somewhat lighter in its action quotient, there's a greater sense of detail imparted to the Wasteland, its two key dictatorial rulers, and how Furiosa gets embroiled in the faction war.

The orange-brown landscape makes an emphatic visual comeback, this time through the photographic eye of DoP Simon Duggan (replacing John Seale). Similar to Fury Road, the film has characters that are constantly on the move. Static shots are hard to come by, but when they do, it feels like a deliberate move to register changing character dynamics. As a result, we once again get to witness incredibly panoramic imagery, with swarms of extras appearing like ants in a shaken nest.

The handmade props, machinery, and vehicles also look their rusty-finest, and one of the main set-pieces featuring a war rig is an absolute blast. There are some hootworthy hyperlapses captured to indicate the passage of time (and hard-hitting labour), along with plenty of transitions. The film follows a chapterwise approach, which works both in favour and against it. The first three are crisp and well-defined, though the last couple feel ill-timed and rushed in parts. Eliot Knapman & Margaret Sixel (Miller's wife) edit the film into an engaging, briskly paced 149-minute flick, with a blink-and-miss appearance of a young Max Rockatansky (+ his interceptor) packed in. Junkie XL's score oscillates between subtle and bombastic, very much in line with the film's overall frenetic approach.

Alyla Browne plays child/teenage Furiosa to perfection, and in her silence, we sense the inner rage and subtle hints of her future badassery. Anya only shows up in the third chapter, and by then, the character motivations are already established. She's terrific in scenes where her eyes do the talking, and makes for a worthy predecessor to Theron. Similar to how Theron stole some (or a lot) of the thunder from Tom Hardy in Fury Road, Chris Hemsworth trumps Anya in several scenes. He puts on a pair of contacts & a prosthetic nose, and brings in shady mannerisms that made me forget Thor altogether.

Dementus is a character I was instantly intrigued by, and the way he conducts his savagery makes him the ideal blend of a smart yet menacing cinematic baddie. There's also a surprising amount of depth attributed to another character known as Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke, looking a lot like AEW wrestler Hangman Adam Page) and his interactions with Furiosa. He also comes across as the only character that Furiosa seems to care about, after her mother's demise early on. And speaking of the mother, Charlee Fraser does a remarkable job in the role (it's a rock-solid Australian ensemble, in short).

I could sit and watch a tonne of these universe-enhancing flicks within the franchise, but only if they're crafted in the capable hands of Miller. Whether we get another film or not remains in question, but I'd be mighty happy if we do. The action is definitely a bit more reliant on CG this time around, though the kinetically shot, smoothly edited long takes keep you on edge. I won't complain at all, since Miller continues to add his distinguished filmmaking vision behind each of these projects.",8.0,26 May 2024
I Went in Cautiously Optimistic... And I Really Liked It!,,8.0,25 May 2024
"Awesome, yet levels below Fury Road","For reference, Mad Max: Fury Road is one of two movies I've awarded my imaginary 11 star rating. I recently watched it for the 13th time and I've liked it better on every viewing. I adore it. But I knew not to expect Furiosa to come anywhere close.

I found this movie to be awesome and entertaining. The action scenes are fantastic and creative. They continue to feel real with all the practical stunts and vehicles. We go much more in depth with the story and background of what we saw in Fury Road. Chris Hemsworth shines as he transforms into a nearly unrecognizable character.

These aren't necessarily negatives, but a few reasons I think this was so many levels below Fury Road. Where is the music? Fury Road has my all-time favorite musical score. It's not just played in the background, it's a prominent part of nearly every scene. In Furiosa, I barely noticed the music. It's so odd because it's even the same composer, Junkie XL.

For playing the title character, Anya Taylor-Joy feels significantly underutilized. She's my current favorite actress, I'm fully aware of her acting talent. I just barely saw it here. By comparison, Charlize Theron gave a phenomenal performance in Fury Road.

Lastly, this is 28 minutes longer than Fury Road but has less action. I didn't mind a heavier focus on story over action... except when we reach a surprisingly anticlimactic, non-action conclusion.

I know it seems like I'm being overly negative. I definitely enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. See it on a premium screen with the loudest speakers.

Masterpiece !,"Just Wow ! Even if you have not watched Mad Max Fury Road. You can still watch it, if you have than this is an amazing treat to watch after a decade from it's previous part. Action scenes are mind blowing, engines roaring, driving scenes, bullets hitting 🔥.

Anya Taylor Joy has played her part beautifully and adapted the role of furiosa perfectly. The vehicles used in the movie is also so much creatively designed. The scenes from the wasteland are just mesmerizing. After a long time i have a movie that i can watch it more than 4-5 times atleast. Little Furiosa has also played her part very nicely. To be true i have just watched this movie cause i am a Mad Max movie series fan and the other reason is ""Anya Taylor Joy"". She is just soo adorable whichever role she plays.

Let's wait another decade for the next part !

Keep up the good work ""MAD MAX"" Team !",10.0,31 May 2024
It's good but it could've been better,"Mad Max is one of my favourite film series and I was really looking forward to this prequel. I went into it viewing it as a standalone prequel film prepared to not compare it to any of the other films and I didn't. That said I felt that this was kind of disappointing for the origin story to what is regarded as one of the most popular action films in recent history (Fury Road). Don't get me wrong, there were many things that I enjoyed about this movie but without going into spoilers the events of this film go straight up into Fury Road and there are still gaps in Furiosa's story that are not explained in this film. Which leaves you to wonder is that it? Did they just not care to explain these points? Aside from that Anya Taylor Joy did give an excellent performance in this, I did however feel that she could've been given more to work with. This movie felt like it gave you everything and nothing at the same time with Furiosa's origin story. I would've loved to have seen more time focused solely on her and less time focused on the supporting characters.",7.0,24 May 2024
Why does she suddenly become American?,"Otherwise, it's basically a perfect movie! Far more scope and character work than FURY ROAD, and stands as a worthy successor.

Bold and inventive design, impeccably paced (it's seriously well edited!), stunning cinematography, epic score, all anchored by storytelling reminiscent of a Shakespearean Greek tragedy.

Had no idea Chris Hemsworth had a performance like that in him. And Anya Taylor-Joy for sure needs more big action vehicles.

My ONLY gripe is that Furiosa suddenly develops an American accent. Where did that come from? Not Taylor-Joy's fault as she needed to match her voice to Charlize Theron. I could have bought the accent if the kid playing Young Furiosa was American too... but she was Aussie like everyone else in the cast. As an Aussie who lives in America, I was pulled out of the story whenever adult Furiosa spoke.

But, yeah, other than that, I think this is a damn near perfect film.",10.0,24 May 2024
Mixed bag for me,"Mad max fury road was entertaining from the beginning to end ..but Furiosa started really well then it began to drag , then came a powerful action sequence.. then again went back to drama, again action , and it continues.. Hemsworth had a acting mannerism if Johnny depp in the beginning.. made me imagine depp in his role.. anya was okay as furiosa , but wasn't badàss enough as the older furiosa ..the child furiosa was awesome , and had a rage in her face.. loved that kid... AS a gore movie lover, there wasn't enough gory scenes .. it's okay.. In the trailer the color grading was more of an orange color and was cartoonish , but in theatre it wasn't like the trailer at all.. Action scenes were great.. they increased the scale of the movie.. spent more money in this.. the climax was really satisfactory.. i was expecting a normal ending, but they gave a brilliant ending.. Sound effects were so good. .was worth watching in theatre .. but somewhere , somewhat felt like the movie was going aimlessly.. then regains the punch .. Expected better.. Fury road was more entertaining.",7.0,27 May 2024
I just...,"Three of us went to see this...one walked out 2/3 in and went home...me and my buddy slogged through it.

I am baffled at any positive reception. It's slow, plodding, with so many of these sped up moments and unnecessary zooms, it's has absolutely no tension whatsoever, Praetorian Jack is the least imposing character in movie history and just horribly miscast. Characters make nonsensical decisions, the world building makes little to no sense (sure in a world with very limited resources just have 1000 guys driving around for no reason, that makes sense)...I literally have nothing positive to say...Fury Road was genius, this is just bleh on every level. It's very clear that its box office failure is warranted.",1.0,26 May 2024
What a lovely day,"Early impressions of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga expressed a fear that it would be a studio-slop cash-in on the ""original"" 2015 Mad Max: Fury Road -- itself a soft reboot of the Mad Max franchise. And although the later trailers and the eventual reviews set our minds straight, God knows how we could have doubted George Miller.

Miller, as many will note, is a singularly varied director. Mad Max: Fury Road is nothing like the Happy Feet movies -- which you may find aren't much like Lorenzo's Oil. His new entry in the Max Max ""saga"", a prequel about Imperator Furiosa (played now by Anya Taylor-Joy, who has never been as ""ethereal yet majestic"" as she is here), also represents the sincere silliness we've been missing in the movies in recent years but is making a comeback.

It is an ingeniously insane roller-coaster of high-octane chases, impossible vehicles getting tossed around, seminal practical effects, pretty good digital ones, wondrously bonkers setpieces, and Chris Hemsworth going freak mode on us in the best performance we've seen from him. Just like last time, the craziness is nonetheless artfully presented, with some of the most precise framing and expressive images of the year.

Admittedly, I was a bit distracted during the film's opening. Sometimes it was too obvious where the VFX began and the real stuff ended (the movie noticeably uses far more digital effects than the prior one), and the costuming and hairstyling didn't give me the impression that this post-apocalyptic Australia (which, as many have already joked, isn't too different from regular Australia) was properly lived-in. Also, as with the previous film in the series, there were some jarringly obvious ADR bits.

Some might take issue with the ""unrealistic"" audio of certain other moments but this is a feature and not a bug. Miller has gone to the Sergio Leone school of ""what isn't on the screen, doesn't exist in the film's universe"": There are numerous shots of characters running into the vast desert, only for a pursuing vehicle to jump into frame without having made a sound before we, the audience, saw it. Not very believable, right? That's the movies for ya.

Sadly, it seems the big talking point lately is the film's disappointing opening weekend, which sparked discussions about the current state of movie theaters. It seemed baffling that such a well-reviewed film did not make more money than this -- even with the theater-going prices and COVID in mind (the latter having changed people's consuming habits on one hand, and significantly worsened the etiquette of those who do still go to the cinema on the other). Twitter user @stunninggun added that the reporting itself may be flawed and that ""we are missing an entire piece of the puzzle: box office pundits are used to Marvel-era openings and we don't live in that world anymore"".

There's another thing to consider: streaming. Many filmgoers have lost faith in it, but even now, many would also rather wait until a certain film is available on a streaming website -- however long it's on there for before it gets deleted with no physical option in sight -- than take the time to drive to a movie theater. (Nowadays, the wait isn't even too long.) We've had some phenomena that prove the power of the theater-going experience (especially when it involves artistry instead of studio sludge), but those of us who quipped ""We are so back"" may have spoken too soon.

On that note, one of my big annoyances re: this film is its name, which was clearly picked not because it rolls off the tongue, but because of Search Engine Optimization -- making sure it appears in the search results when people try to find Mad Max on Prime or whatever (it's why we have titles like A Star Wars Story, From the Book of Saw, and, best and catchiest of all, The Origin of Batman's Butler). I think this title, for a lot of people, was probably the biggest clue that we were getting sauceless cash-grab slop.

Instead, Miller is cooking with as much fire and gas(oline) as ever. I have faith that this movie, in due time, will be as beloved as Fury Road eventually became. But do yourself a favor -- do movie theaters a favor -- and go see this post-apocalyptic powerhouse in an auditorium.

I agree that streaming is convenient and we can sometimes find great art there, but theaters are the place where cinema truly gets to awe and move us. No matter what Ted Sarandos and his ""watched Lawrence of Arabia on his iPhone and liked it fine"" son would have you think.",8.0,28 May 2024
Don't sleep on this,"If you enjoyed Fury Road, this follow up/prequel definitely delivered exquisitely!

The theater expirence was (like for Fury Road) a perfect screen to really capture the expansive wasteland and magnificent action sequences of pure mayhem.

The characters were very well developed and gives you a good taste of how the story progresses to Fury Road (definitely better off watching it first if you haven't already).

Hemsworth was amazing in his role with perfect amounts of charisma blended up with his psycho demeanor may have stolen the show from Anya; who in her own right did a fantastic job.

The film certainly had that Frank Miller style, little dirty, little choppy etc but the story did kind of lag a bit here and there (similar to FR) but over all is enjoyable and I'd definitely rewatch it.",9.0,27 May 2024
The Long Awaited Prequel Lives up to the Hype,"As of this month, the long awaited prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road known as Furiosa has finally been released to the world. Starring the likes of Anya Taylor-Joy as the titular character and Chris Hemsworth, the film has proven to be a strong contender for the Mad Max franchise with notable critical acclaim and a modest opening weekend at the time this is being written. Usually, when prequels or spin offs of popular blockbuster movies come out, their reception is usually underwhelming at best. So how does this film stand as an ambitious inclusion into George Miller's insane saga?

Set roughly 15 to 20 years prior to the events of Fury Road, the film chronicles Furiosa's heartbreaking life from being kidnapped as a child by the forces of warlord Dementus to her seeking revenge as an adult on the warlord for the loss of her mother. In just under 2 and a half hours, this film manages to detail just enough of Furiosa's dangerous upbringing, whether by struggling as a slave under Dementus's control, or becoming a trusted lieutenant under the Citadel's cult leader, Immortan Joe, to yearning for her own home of the Green Place where life prospers amidst the war crimes over water, food, weapons, and gasoline. By keeping the storyline largely straightforward without using unnecessary flashbacks or jumping ahead too soon, Furiosa largely works as a character driven journey thanks largely by the character herself. Anya Taylor-Joy looks and comes off surprisingly similar to Charlize Theron's performance, but Alyla Browne's largely mute performance captures Furiosa's trauma and anger with such a vigorous drive that keeps the first half on its toes.

Speaking of the cast, Chris Hemsworth makes for an effectively ruthless presence as Dementus, complete with a mix of cunning ham and callous malice that makes him and his crew thoroughly loathsome. In addition, returning from Fury Road is the aforementioned Immortan Joe, his war crazy sons Rictus and Scrotus and the Organic Mechanic, all of whom play their own roles with such ferocity without going completely mad, at least in the case of Joe who's mere nuanced presence makes him arguably scarier than his more bombastic sons. Some characters in the film might be hard to truly know who to root for or be against, but the commander of the Citadel's war rig Praetorian Jack is arguably the most sympathetic aid of Furiosa due to his vulnerability deep inside a tough exterior and a humanesque performance courtesy of Tom Burke. Although most people will come in to see Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth work off of each other, and indeed they do, the supporting players are what make the entire feature truly harrowing and engaging to watch from start to finish.

In continuing the insane world-building and top tier stunt & effects work from Fury Road, the filmmakers managed to up the ante while still keeping some scenes more low key in contrast. With much of the crew from Fury Road returning, including composer Tom Holkenborg, costume designer Jenny Beavan, editor Margaret Sixel (Miller's wife), and co-writer Nico Lathouris, the world of Furiosa feels much more expansive to the post apocalyptic Australian wasteland with elaborate set locations, intense car chases, near impossible stunt work, post punk jaggery costumes, and an overall feeling of complete madness. To keep the flow going through so many different plot points, the insane effects and stunt work is saved for the more life threatening sequences, thus allowing the more human moments to play out as long as they need to. Other Mad Max films have done this as well, but this is the longest installment in the franchise, so you really feel the weight being lifted once a quieter scene comes into play. There's much to appreciate from these filmmaking vets nearly 10 years later.

It's often a miracle when a prequel to a beloved feature in an already well established franchise turns out good if not great in the end, and thankfully Furiosa delivers quite well. Thanks in large part to some stellar performances, a concisely multilayered storyline, and phenomenal filmmaking qualities, this film works well as a spinoff without feeling like a nostalgia bait cash grab. If you're a fan of the Mad Max series or you're in the mood for some substantive blockbuster fun, then this is a must watch for the summer movie season. It's incredible how even nearing 80 years old, George Miller still has it in him.",9.0,28 May 2024
George Miller's heavy-metal action franchise continues to deliver.,"Furiosa: A Mad Max saga is a terrific odyssey that not only serves as a great companion piece to Mad Max: Fury Road, but is also an exhilarating experience in its own right. Wonderful performances, state-of-the-art stunt work and an unconventional audiovisual storytelling style make this one of the best theatre experiences of the year.

Furiosa adopts an episodic storytelling approach, spanning nearly 20 years over the course of 5 chapters. A particularly bold choice was focusing the first 2 chapters (that amount to nearly half the runtime) on a younger version of Furiosa(played by Alyla Browne), with Anya-Taylor Joy being introduced only towards the end of the first half. This does make the chapters feel a bit disjointed and incoherent, but is integral to the development of the lead character.

Another bold choice was the adoption of a more subtle compared to Fury Road, with a greater emphasis on character-building moments compared to action set-pieces. While some may find this disappointing, I found the balance between action and drama to be just right. That being said, the action scenes in this film are a work of art. The stunt work mesmerising, the visual effects are gorgeous and the raw, guttural sound design(with a subtle use of the background score) adds to the tension.

Anya-Taylor Joy does a fabulous job of replacing Charlize Theron as Furiosa, perfectly portraying the emotional torment that her character endures over the course of the film. Alyla Browne delivers one of the best child performances of recent times, and Chris Hemsworth steals the show as Dementus. He is funny, psychotic and completely relentless, which is exactly what you'd expect from someone named Dementus. Tom Burke is also brilliant as Praetorian Jack, whose relationship with Furiosa deepens the emotional core of the film.

While Furiosa: A Mad Max saga may not answer all the questions about Fury Road, it is a really good character study and an enriching prequel that has the great blend of action, drama and emotion. It is truly a privilege to see George Miller's enduring passion and dedication towards his signature franchise.",8.0,26 May 2024
Furiosa - A Fragmented Saga,"FINALLY! I got to see George Millers triumphant return to the world he so beautifully re-established in Fury Road back in 2015. This time with a completely new storytelling approach, new characters, and some glimpses into many of the mysterious places only hinted at before.

The difference this time around can quickly be summed up as: CGI takes a step forward, while composer Junkie XL takes a step back. The tight and high octane rollercoaster structure is gone, in favour of a more classic saga spanning almost two decades. With a stronger focus on exposition, in contrast to Furys Roads ""less is more"" type of storytelling. And I'm all for it, because I sure as hell don't want to WATCH (as much as I imagine Miller don't want to MAKE) the same film again.

And the result? Well, it's a mixed bag for sure that has lingered in my mind since I left the cinema 2 days ago. My biggest issue with this film is how incapable it is to stand on it's own two feet. It feels like ""Furiosa"" is spending most of it's runtime setting up for Fury Road instead of trying to be it's own thing. A sort of montage/checklist that's all about filling in the blanks, and connect the dots on the things we already know. Like ""How did she loose her arm? How did she end up at the Citadel? How did she meet that character"" etc etc. Instead of just telling a focused, cohesive and satisfying story more intimitely connected to the films title.

As a die-hard fan of Fury Road, every one of these fragments are super interesting of course. But on the other hand, the mystery of it didn't bother me at all in Fury Road. Quite the opposit really - It elevated it!

All these snippets and throwbacks, together with wonderful new additions like the fantastic character and story of Dementus - The film quickly turns into an overstuffed bag. Where enough potential for expansion flashes by on the screen to fill a triology! But instead it's all crammed into one which unfortunately makes the film feel a bit too rushed, disjointed and trailer-like for my taste. It leaves us with so many missed oppurtunities of emotional connection and deeper understanding of Furiosas character and journey. Beats mostly left off screen, between cuts, or simply not given the proper time to evolve or sink in.

For example (MINOR SPOILER) there's a scene where Furiosa teams up with Road warrior ""Praetorian Jack"", who in return promises to teach the ""skills you'll need to get wherever you wanna go.."" CUT TO: Okay we're done, feel free to leave... The time skipped in this jumpcut alone, could easily serve as a great premise for an entire film I would LOVE to see! That feeling hit me multiple times throughout this film.

While writing this I get the feeling that it probably sounds like I don't like Furiosa, but believe it or not I actually do! (mostly) I still loved spending time in this world again. I love the characters and all of the over-the-top craziness that Miller throws at me. I gotta admit it's tempting to give the whole film a pass based purely on it's high ambition, crazy imagination, beautiful craftmanship, and once again - SPECTACULAR action! But, I just can't.. And to be fair, what could possibly be enough to match one of the best action films of all time?

So don't get me wrong, even if it can't be praised on the same level as it's predecessor imo - It truly is a spectacle to behold, and worth seeing on the largest screen possible. The amazing cinematography, editing, performances, sound design, set pieces - It's all still there. I just wish they'd taken a step further away from the shadow of Fury Road, and wrote it's own glorious path to Valhalla.",7.0,26 May 2024
Wonderful addition to the Mad Max Universe.,"If you enjoyed Fury Road, there's plenty to love in Furiosa. The roaring engines, stunning cinematography, and fantastic world-building create an immersive experience. While Furiosa excels in many areas, there are moments where Fury Road shines brighter.

Story and Characters

The decision to focus on Furiosa was a brilliant one. Charlize Theron made the character unforgettable in Fury Road, and Anya Taylor-Joy does her justice in this installment. The characters are well-developed, and the story delves deep into the rich world George Miller has crafted. Furiosa's journey is tragic yet compelling, weaving seamlessly into the narrative of Fury Road. As a prequel, it stands firmly on its own, with plenty of references for Fury Road Fans fans.

Chris Hemsworth delivers one of his best performances as the villain. It's refreshing to see him in a different light, although his character lacks the depth of Furiosa. The reappearance of the villains from Fury Road in a more neutral role is intriguing, and it would have been nice to see more of them. It was good to see more of Gastown and Bullet Farm. The film has a strong start, a solid middle part, and a satisfying ending that ties neatly into the Fury Road story.

Action and Visuals.

The action in Furiosa is plenty fun and creative, they rely more on CGI than the practical effects that made Fury Road so raw and visceral. George Miller uses CGI creatively, crafting action scenes that fit perfectly into the Mad Max universe and Furiosa's story. The balance of CGI and practical action in Fury Road was one of its greatest strengths. In Furiosa, the biggest action scenes are CGI-heavy, lacking the same impact. Despite this, the film's overall feel isn't diminished. There are still plenty of amazing stunts and practical effects that keep the action grounded and exciting.

Miller's ability to blend the chaos of action with wonderful cinematography is masterful. His signature camerawork is ever present during this high-octane and explosive journey.

Furiosa is a worthy prequel to Fury Road, offering a thrilling ride with deep character development and a richly detailed world.",9.0,26 May 2024
A Good Prequel about a Great Character,"9 years after the release of Mad Max: Fury Road we finally have the release of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, unfortunately it has been suffering at the box office but I managed to watch it last night and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the origin of Furiosa and how she would grow into the character we meet in Fury Road.

Main Character Anya Taylor Joy takes over the role of Furiosa and I thought she encapsulated the role perfectly. I truly believed that she was a younger version of Charlize Theron's interpretation of the character. It does take a while to introduce her in the film and she doesn't have too many lines here but similar to Tom Hardy's performance as Max she gives a very physical performance which just works. Also credit to Alyla Browne who plays the even younger version of the character for the first hour and she she does a great job too.

Supporting Characters But the star of this show has to be Chris Hemsworth playing the villain Dementus. He absolutely owns every scene that he is in and is this over the top Australian leader who is oozing charisma and charm and Hemsworth is clearly having a load of fun and he gives one of his best performances here.

We get Immortan Joe back here, though he is played by a different actor called Lachy Hulme but you wouldn't realise that from the film. It is cool seeing a younger version of the character and you do realise why he has all the devoted troops to his cause.

But the rest of the cast aren't particularly great. Tom Burke plays Jack and he is incredibly dull, he is kind of introduced as a companion of Furiosa but he adds nothing to the film and this guy delivers his lines in super boring fashion and I did not care about him at all.

Story The story is really good, I criticised Mad Max: Fury Road for its lack of story but this film is totally different and tells a really engaging story where we grow to really care and support Furiosa even if we didn't know her from a previous film. This is clearly a revenge tale and it does slightly take its time but I appreciate how Furiosa develops and becomes an interesting character.

Script The script is okay and I would say that it is better then the previous film especially when Hemsworth is just monologuing and giving these great moments. But the film lacks true dramatic moments and moments that will make a viewer care.

Style The film once again looks fantastic, the visuals are some of the best you will see in any film out there. The action scenes are good and do their job effectively, though they do feel like they have been lessened and aren't anywhere near as grand and crazy as Fury Road. The film also has some slight pacing issues in its first act which means it takes a while to get going.

Overall Overall, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a good film and serves the character of Furiosa well. If you are a fan of that character and this universe then you will like this film. I would say go support this film as it needs to be doing better at the box office as I wouldn't mind seeing more stories in the Mad Max universe in the future.

FURIOSA!!!,,9.0,26 May 2024
Riding the Path of Vengeance,"About a decade ago, Mad Max: Fury Road was a heavily overestimated reboot of the dystopian Australian franchise that offered eye candy over substance, just like the underwhelming Dune trilogy that is currently being praised for unfathomable reasons. I'm however glad to announce that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a significant improvement over its predecessor and overall a very good post-apocalyptic action-drama.

The story revolves around the titular heroine who is kidnapped as a child. Her mother does everything she can to save her but ends up being caught and crucified. The murderer attempts to raise Furiosa as his own daughter until he decides to sell her to a wealthy businessman. Thus begins Furiosa's insatiable quest for vengeance that will take fifteen years of her life.

This movie convinces for numerous reasons. First and foremost, the diversified settings are remarkably beautiful. Bullet Farm, the Citadel and Gas Town complete one another magnificently. The Wasteland offers enough diversity with dunes, rocks and quicksands to remain interesting throughout. The shining highlight is the remarkable oasis The Green Place as the movie shows very well why people are willing to sacrifice their lives to save this heavenly location of abundance.

Up next, the film's special effects are stunning. This starts with the way the different characters age in fifteen years. It continues with the numerous experimental engines that can be seen throughout the film. The genuine highlights are however the fighting sequences that culminate in the movie's resolution.

The acting performances are also strong. Anya Taylor-Joy convinces as gritty heroine of few words. Chris Hemsworth delivers the goods as manipulative antagonist with narcissistic tendencies. Charlee Fraser astonishes as resilient mother willing to sacrifice her life to save her daughter. This movie comes around with a memorable cast of eclectic characters.

You might now wonder why this movie hasn't received an even higher rating. Let's point out a few minor flaws for the sake of justification. First and foremost, this movie overstays its welcome with a length of one hundred forty-eight minutes. Do you remember how the first Mad Max film was only ninety-three minutes long? This is the quality standard the franchise should aim to be returning to.

Up next, the film's plot is as predictable as it gets. Dystopian science-fiction movies have been overdone in the past decade and a half and the quality of the scriptwriting has overall been on a downward spiral. In addition to that, the movie tells a most simple tale of vengeance that doesn't request any kind of intellectual effort from the viewers.

Lastly, this new film could have been connected more smoothly to the other entries in the franchise. Especially the final twenty minutes feel chaotic, disorganized and rushed. Since the makers of this film had already taken more than two hours to tell the whole story, they should have invested an additional ten to fifteen minutes to connect the dots and offer a fluid resolution.

At the end of the day, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a very good science-fiction film that should be appreciated by fans of the franchise and potential new fans alike. A new Mad Max movie is also going to be seeing the light of day in the near future. Dystopian science-fiction cinema has however become uninspired, predictable and lazy throughout the past decade and a half. Instead of pushing this franchise to excessive lengths with more prequels, reboots and sequels, the makers should bring the franchise to a captivating, honourable and respectable conclusion as soon as possible.",7.0,30 May 2024
"Mad Action, But No Max Entertainment","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) Review -

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga marks George Miller's return to the Mad Max franchise as he brings a prequel to his 2015 mad action classic, Mad Max: Fury Road. You can forget the first three Mad Max movies featuring Mel Gibson, and you can even forget Fury Road in case you are worried about the timelines and characters of Furiosa. Fury Road had some breathtaking and magnificent action set pieces and stunts that blew my mind almost a decade ago. Miller made the best Mad Max movie ever without a hard storyline, and he attempts a similar thing with the prequel, only to fall short by miles. Miller and Miles-what a combination I've found there! Furiosa has some brilliant action blocks that leave you in thrills, but we are used to them since Miller served us the same dish in 2015, which was fresh and new back then. Today, it felt repetitive, and again, the writing dried out in the first half only.

A young Furiosa is abducted from her homeland, known as an abundance place, by members of the Horde of the Biker Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). He trades her with Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), the leader of the Citadel, in exchange for food, water, and oil. Years later, Dememtus' people are turned rogue and are on the verge of killing each other due to a shortage of food and oil, and he demands an increase in supply from Joe. Growing up, Furiosa seeks revenge and is trained as a warrior and a soldier by Jack. Will she be able to finish Dementus and save herself from Joe?

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a lengthy revenge saga that feels too stretched in the second half. It was a simple revenge drama, unnecessarily pulled to the point where it became a boring saga. There are flaws. Yes, many of them. One such flaw was Furiosa leaving Dementus hanging on the machine when she could have easily killed him. It takes her the next 30 minutes to repeat a similar attack, and that too without a left hand. That seemed too silly for a revenge drama in 2024. A similar mistake was made in the beginning when young Furiosa returned for her mother as if she were going to save her, abandoning her own mother's orders and plans. Towards the end, we hear about a 40-day war of wasteland, but unfortunately, the screenplay writer and director both did not bother to show us that, which could have been the grandest action sequence in the entire movie. On the positive side, we have terrific action blocks at the pre-climax and pre-interval points that deserve to be seen on a large screen format like IMAX.

Anya Taylor-Joy finally appears in the movie after the first hour is over. That's less screen time compared to what Christ has here, and the funny thing is that the movie is titled after her name, Furiosa. Anyway, she was good in her role. It was unlikely to see her in gorgeous and glamorous avatars, but let me tell you, she did look scary enough with the black rubbing on her forehead. Chris Hemsworth plays an antagonist with humor. His English, his accent, his actions, his decisions-everything is somewhat immature, yet he feels dangerous. The make-up was visible in how they wanted to make him look a little different from the actual Chris. Lachy Hulme as Immorta Joe is the most frightening face in Furiosa, and I wish he had more screen space (which wasn't possible because he played the main villain in the sequel). Nathan Jones, Josh Helman, John Howard, Charlee Fraser, Angus Sampson, Jacob Tomuri, Daniel Webber, and others have done pretty okay in the supporting roles.

Simon Duggan has provided excellent cinematography for Furiosa: A Mad Max. We see some close angles that take your breath away, while those dusty and speedy chase sequences put your eyes at work by not letting your attention move anywhere. The background score goes too loud in some scenes, but the rest of the time it was pretty good. Furiosa follows a similar set design as Mad Max Fury Road, or rather a little dull comparatively, but it looks lavish and grand. The first frame of Charlee Fraser (Mary), when she rides away to save her daughter, and the camera goes wide and backwards to show us the full picturesque design of an abundance place. The same could have been done during the war sequence, but... they missed it. The visual effects are good, and IMAX viewing is mandatory in order to have a close look at those beautiful visuals. George Miller is widely known for the Mad Max franchise, and he has made it popular globally. Moreover, the Mad Max franchise has given him popularity all over the world. None of his other films are that kind of mad action movie, nor do any of his other films have a similar impact as Mad Max 2 and Fury Road. If you see the pattern, he has made one memorable film and then gone down with the next movie. Fury Road was a peak point, and so Furiosa is, what can I say, a step or two lower than the standard he set for himself and us viewers. He could have made it better, much sharper, faster, and more entertaining. If you are expecting the same magic as Fury Road, then you'll be disappointed. If not, you have a decent watch.

A masterpiece of epic proportions. Witness it.,,10.0,25 May 2024
Must watchable. Excellent acting and screenplay,The movie is must watchable in mad max saga ever. The acting of Chris Hemsworth as a villain is very perfect to cast him. Screenplay is good and many exciting details are left for mad max fans. Newly many places are shown. The screentime for chris Hemsworth (Demantos) and furiosa is perfectly handled. In this movie Immortan Joe is not main villain so don't expect anything from Joe. The action scenes are so interesting and also road chase scenes but it was not completely like fury road but it's ok. All costumes are really good and all things are given grounded so that it could connect to all audiences. The music is also good. Don't miss it.,9.0,24 May 2024
Right up there with Fury Road!!,"Furiosa is right up there with fury road and better.

George Miller is a genius. Anya Taylor Joy is excellent but Chris Hemsworth is the heart of this film. The child actress did a fabulous job too. Every character serves a purpose. No fillers. Just spectacular action. As a fan of the original trilogy, my only wish is to see some of these characters in a pre apocalyptic setting just as i had wished to see lord humungous in a similar setting. What was it like for these guys in the real world. Was immorton joe a policeman or a postman? So many questions to ask but i suppose its just wishful thinking. Go Watch it in Theatres.",10.0,28 May 2024
Run to the theater. Holy Freaking Crap!,"#chompcrc here. This is the best movie I've seen in quite some time. George Miller is an absolute genius behind the camera. Everyone that he surrounds himself with are top notch. The writing is amazing. The acting is phenomenal. Chris Hemsworth is the best and most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. He deserves an Oscar for this one. I had no idea he could do this. The layers that unfold like a slowly rotting onion are a master class in filmmaking. There is so much being said about society, the human condition, and our willingness to pursue vengeance despite ourselves. The way the story unfolds is so fulfilling. I love that they spent time with Furiosa as a child instead of jumping right into her as a young adult. Seeing this makes her arc in Fury Road all the more tragic and satisfying at the same time. You must watch this in the theater. It deserves to be watched on the big screen. I cannot praise this film enough. I haven't seen anything this entertaining, exiting, epic, masterful, or downright amazing in so long that I can't even compare it to anything except for Fury Road. The difference is, that is the greatest action film of all time, and this is one of the greatest films of all time, while also being an action film. There's even a quick little cameo of Mad Max. Run to the theater and watch this.",10.0,27 May 2024
Go see it!,"You'll like it. This is a movie you'll want to see in theaters. It's what theaters are made for. It's full to the brim of action based storytelling.

The cars do not disappoint, though you'll see primarily motorcycles. The soundtrack is good, sometimes great. Costume design is good. Sets are interesting but there's a bit more CGI than I'd prefer. The world building was satisfying, and made up for the fairly unoriginal and choppy character backstory I'm not a big fan of the main actors, but they did just fine.

It's not Fury Road but it could never be. It was a good prequel! But I wouldn't have cared for the movie as much had I not seen Fury Road first.",7.0,27 May 2024
"Liked Furiosa's story, but I do miss Max.",,8.0,26 May 2024
"7,5/10: A fantastic pure action film in a unique setting","Creative and exciting action sequences. So many eccentric choices with equipment, wardrobe and characters. I loved ann taylor-joy but chris hemsworth's character almost ruined the film. Everytime he has a longer monologue, I started to lose immersion in the film and just got annoyed. Maybe the character needs to be approached from a different perspective since he is not a traditional antagonist.

The beginning was slow but not in a bad way, still good, just did not expect it. Rest of the movie was thrilling action right until the end where the pace of the movie slowed down abrubtly.

I think this busy and fast-paced movie needs to be rewatched to savour every little detail but also to appreciate it as a whole. I think my rating has the potential to be bumped up to an 8 after rewatching the movie again sometime.",7.0,28 May 2024
Just AS good as Fury Road!,"The title says it all.

This is a great and worthy prequel that leads directly into Fury Road. Beautifully shot with great action and awesome performances from everyone. Not sure how some people are throwing out 5's and 6's on here. They clearly didn't watch the same movie as I did. Besides the incredible action, the film has a large amount of heart and backstory than I expected it to have. Not sure if this is the last movie in George Miller's ""Mad Max saga"" but I certainly hope not. If they can somehow keep cranking these films out, I'll be there each and every time.

Furiosa deserves to be seen in theaters.

Such a wild, fun and relentless ride.",9.0,27 May 2024
Close But No Cigar,,7.0,28 May 2024
"Lots of action, but falls short","The movie had a lot of action but the storyline was lacking in terms of character development for Furiosa. The love ""interest"" was unnecessary. The casting was also an issue because Taylor-Joy is too small and delicate to believe her as Furiosa growing up in a tough environment with harsh climates & a male dominated place. She was also too pretty to be believable because if there were women that weren't ""wives"" the faces of the women had scares and mutilations, but somehow Taylor-Joy maintains a beautiful face the entire movie. Also the casting of Hemsworth's wife as two separate characters was distracting from the film as well making it difficult to stay immersed in the fantasy.",3.0,28 May 2024
A Top-Notch Prequel,"A young Furiosa is kidnapped by bikers who work for Lord Dementus. They take her away from the Green Place of Many Mothers, they kill her mother that tried to rescue her and they roam the wasteland before finding Citadel led by Immortan Joe. The two warlords engage in a war for Citadel while Furiosa lays low to plot her way back home and to get revenge on the man that took everything from her.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga succeeds on nearly every level. It is great as its own action movie and it serves as a fantastic prequel to Fury Road. It is an action movie epic that somehow manages to gather all of the interesting elements from all four Mad Max movies to deliver an epic tale of revenge, survival and war. It combines the revenge theme of the first film, the post-apocalyptic war setting in Road Warrior, the world-building of Beyond Thunderdome and the visceral and insane action of Fury Road to deliver a prequel that compliments Mad Max: Fury Road beautifully.

The tone of this movie is not as dark as Fury Road as the bad guy in this movie is a little more humorous and the situation is not quite as bleak as Fury Road, but it is still an intense and dark movie. The story is about power control over two evil warlords and Furiosa trying to stay alive and get her revenge on Dementus. It is about how Furiosa's whole childhood gets taken from her so she becomes the stoic and quiet warrior that she is as an adult. This is a revenge tale on a much bigger scale than the original Mad Max as she goes up against a much bigger threat and more enemies. It is an enthralling story that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

The pacing is slower than Mad Max: Fury Road because it is more character focused and there is more world-building here, but Furiosa is constantly engaging because of the character drama and the incredible world-building that sets up the war in the wasteland. Furiosa's character gets expanded upon too as we see why she becomes as rebellious as she is and how she got a mechanical arm. This movie fleshes out not just the world of Mad Max, but the character of Furiosa too. I also love how in this conflict between two warlords throwing everything they have at each other, she just wants to make Dementus pay for taking away her childhood.

While I prefer the set pieces in Fury Road just on a visual and spectacle level, Furiosa has some breathtaking action in its own right. The standouts include the battle of The Bullet Farm and the chase scene that goes on for 15 minutes! Both of these set pieces are filled to the brim with impressive stunt work, beautiful cinematography and choreography, sweeping camera work and sheer intensity. There is so much back and forth on who has the advantage in these chases and the tactics the combatants use to fight that it adds to complexity of the action. Also, the parachute fighters are awesome here adding a layer of coolness to the movie. The climactic sequence is mesmerizing especially in the final confrontation between Furiosa and Dementus. One of the most chilling climaxes of the year and that I have seen in recent memory.

The visuals look breathtaking as the movie uses several tracking shots and beautiful imagery that has a few disturbing images. Also, this movie has a few graphic moments, one of which made my jaw drop. It is not because it is bloody, but it is an important part of Furiosa's story told in the coolest way possible. Between this movie and Dune: Part Two, this is a great year for movies that take place in desert areas. The costumes and makeup are all on point as we would expect from a Mad Max film. The direction by George Miller is dynamic as he delivers in telling an engaging story in a visually thrilling and narratively epic way. The soundtrack by Tom Holkenberg is not quite as strong as Junkie XL's masterful score in Fury Road, but it is very good with the music in the final 30 minutes sending chills down my spine. This movie is a marvel on a technical level, matching its already fantastic story.

Anya Taylor-Joy does not show up as Furiosa until around the second act, but once she does we can see how this woman nails the character. For a role that gives her minimal dialogue, she makes the most of it with her presence in every scene she is in, especially in the climactic scene. From the attitude, to Furiosa's mannerisms and to her stoic personality, Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a captivating lead performance as the title character that gives Furiosa more depth and personality just with her expressions and actions. I saw Furiosa in each of her scenes. She is proving with each film she stars in that she is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood between this, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Northman and The Menu. Also, Alyla Browne captures the young Furiosa perfectly as well pinpointing the moment she loses her childhood.

Chris Hemsworth makes for a fantastic and memorable villain as Lord Dementus. I could tell Hemsworth relished in playing as a bad guy m, but he takes the role very seriously at the same time. While Dementus is not as outright depraved as Immortan Joe, he is an intimidating and clever villain in his own right despite some goofy moments. Also, he is probably the most human villain I have seen in a while. Dementus is very powerful and ruthless giving the audience many reasons to root against him, but what makes him memorable is that by the end of the film, we are reminded that he is human just like everyone else in the wasteland. He might be my favorite villain in this saga because he is fun to root against, he has some surprising amount of depth and Chris Hemsworth delivers on every aspect of this character.

The supporting cast is pretty solid too. Charlee Fraser is magnificent as Furiosa's mother saying so much with just her eyes alone. This is one of the best examples of small role, big impact I have seen in a while. Lachy Hulme is very good as a younger Immortan Joe, nailing his mannerisms. Tom Burke makes for a solid supporting character as Praetorian Jack who serves as a love interest for Furiosa. Burke shares a surprisingly sweet chemistry with Anya Taylor-Joy in a film filled with no hope and death. John Howard is fun as the people eater and Nathan Jones is surprisingly unsettling as Rictus. This is a great supporting cast that compliments the amazing leads.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is breathtaking in so many ways. It is a whole different beast from Mad Max: Fury Road, but this is a great prequel that builds on the universe these movies take place in that also improves the story of Fury Road by adding depth to Furiosa and the dangerous wasteland of a world. It also succeeds as its own action movie epic with an engaging story and enthralling sequences filled with beautiful destruction and dynamic stunts. I adore this movie and I think it will remain as one of my favorite movies of 2024 and as one my favorite blockbusters of the decade. See Furiosa on the biggest screen possible.",9.0,25 May 2024
A really good movie,"I enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. This movies shouldn't be compared to Fury Road since it's composed completely different way. Fury Road is completely all about the action and this is mix of lore and action. Both of the movies works excellent on their own field. However, I can't really give like 9 or 10 since there are some clumsy moments in the movie. I feel that the editing is not so great from time to time as it feels like there are some small pieces missing between scenes. This doesn't occur always but on some cases. I also felt little bit of disappointing that there was lack of music in some scenes.

This movie totally shines on giving coherent complete story arc of Furiosa. It occurerd to me how perfectly seamless the whole story from little Furiosa to adult Furiosa was in the movie. A character who is completely driven by revenge. This kind of almost perfect story arc is rather rare occasion in movies. Especially nowadays. I felt that the scope of the movie, as in what details it shows from the world of Mad Max, is done extremely well. Everything in that sense clicks perfectly well.

One of the rare movies which I went to see multiple times in the cinema.",8.0,1 June 2024
I had not expected such high quality!,"Great start, until, yes, Chris Hemsworth's clownish appearance, already a questionable casting decision in the trailer-only period. That doesn't change a prominent nose or a script full of cruel deeds, he doesn't embody the super-villain, the Leader Of Evil. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a general aversion, I liked him last in the role of Tyler Rake, for example. Anyway, the only explanation: nobody can be bigger than Immortan Joe. Enough of the negative flavour, this end time makes an impression, this twilight of the gods is fun. Even without continuous action, instead a little cosy Thunderdome feeling in between. Digression and variation were necessary, both after 1981 and 2015, but continuous fire alone wears off quickly. And then again, a huge Mad Max 2 homage, even with more than a little Max clone, both in spirit and physically. Or Stacy Keach?

150 minutes is a chunk of film, but a restless ride through this apocalyptic hell is guaranteed at all times. And at the end, Hemsworth even gets a chance to redeem himself as a mime. Predicate successful.

By the way, to all those born after 2000, the gnomes who ranked Fury Road or even Furiosa ahead of Part 2. No green screen or keyboard creation can be as wild, as crazy, as groundbreaking as real haptic film art.",8.0,30 May 2024
Great origin story!!!,"This could have easily been a TV series. Only because of the time line from little girl to current Furiosa age. But then we probably would have not gotten The octane feuled chase scenes and over the top cinematic special effects. I love how it's still caters to the Australian acting and does not waver from what they want.

This movie is definitely meant to be seen with some high powered speakers and bass. There are so much motor throttling Bring you that much closer to the movie. There's being an original story. It does tie in to the first original movie. Very well and will not disappoint. Please go Go and see this movie in the theater. You might be disappointed if you don't.",10.0,29 May 2024
"Not Fury Road, but not bad","Miller constructed this film from many of the same elements that defined ""Fury Road"" and have come to define the ""Mad Max"" saga in general. So you get epic chases across desert landscapes and action set pieces that blow your mind and bizarre feudal lords battling over a post-apocalyptic wasteland. In that sense, this movie definitely delivers. For much of it, i was riveted and enthralled, just like i was 10 years ago when the last edition was in theaters. That said, this movie may share the same DNA of ""Fury Road""...but it isn't at that level. It takes a little too long to get going and the sprawl of the story resulted in a little less momentum, as well. I still dug both the action and the origin story (and I'm glad I watched it on a big screen), but this chapter showed just how it is tough to follow-up on a masterpiece.",7.0,3 June 2024
George Miller Does it Again !!!,"Blown Away!!!...Simply blown away by this prequel by George Miller.

Furiosa outshines as one of the best prequels ever made. I thought it would not be easy to top Fury Road but this visionary director masterfully crafts this movie by enthralling chapters to engage the audience in more ways than one.

The opening sequence had my heart pouncing all the way till it ended. Hats off to Chris Hemsworth for truly shining as Dementus the demented antagonist with no remorse. Anya Taylor Joy does absolute justice to the younger Furiosa as we get to see her side of story building up to Fury Road. Love her """"I WANT IT BACK"". However, Immortan Joe is not the main villain in this one as Mr. Dementus surely takes the cake.

Go & See this amazing spectacle of Action at the largest screen possible !!!",8.0,29 May 2024
Your ticket to Valhalla,"Furiosa starts of with a bang, getting right into the action and even more world building for us, the audience to gaze at. It's always odd seeing nature or even an array of colours in a Mad Max landscape but when you do it is a visual delicacy.

Throughout the movie, Furiosa shows us how crafty, nimble and a warrior she is. From a child who witnessed what the wasteland can do to people, grows to adapt and fight for her place in a world that she does not know.

The movie, while being a prequel centers on past characters already seen and as mentioned before, allows more depth to past movies. The action scenes are top notch and bring you in to feel the heat of what it would be like to be in the wasteland.

Anya Taylor-Joy does a good job as a younger and slightly broken Furiosa, she leans into the Mad Max type, quiet and dominating. Chris Hemsworth plays a wasteland boss set on taking over everything, he even breaks away from just being 'Thor' in this movie.

While the stakes for the main character are never in doubt, you can still go in and enjoy the world that this is set in and indulge in seeing the vulgarness of the characters we have seen in the past.

Chrome your mouth and be witnessed as Valhalla comes in this action packed movie.",7.0,30 May 2024
"Mad Max is George Miller's Conan, Furiosa is his Red Sonja","Furiosa is very much be a spectacle that can only be seen in a proper theatre.

In some ways it's superior to Mad Max: Fury Road, in other ways it is inferior. I appreciated the unusual story structure of this movie set in the Mad Max universe. This is not the standard plotline of ""reluctant ronin is dropped into a war between two clans & leads one to a promised land"", the trademark of all Mad Max movies beyond the 1979 original. This is a story of perseverance and vengeance, with much of the crazy stunts, atmosphere and road battles that made Fury Road a sleeper hit...and some you will not expect at all.

Furiosa isn't Fury Road, and I didn't expect it to be. It's more of a frantic mirror to Max Rockatansky's story in the first Mad Max movie, with a main villain as charismatic as Hugh Keays-Byrne's biker baddie Toecutter. Much like Toecutter, Chris Hemsworth's warlord Dementus also leads a clan of deranged bikers. But he's a much more comical & larger than life antagonist. Hemsworth steals every scene he's in. His scumbaggery made me laugh out loud several times, and I wasn't alone. A highlight of the movie. A less decrepit Immortan Joe is a presence in the film, played well enough by Lachy Hulme. You get more insight into his fortress society, more zany Warboys, and several colorful new characters. If you've played the 2015 Mad Max game you may recognize a couple.

Now, where this movie fails a bit, is the VFX department. The effects are spotty in a few parts. I don't know if it was a creative decision, but it's a bit puzzling. It's also odd as the effects in other areas are fantastic, like the deepfaking of Anna Joy Taylor's face on the impressive actress playing young Furiosa. It's a little disappointing the movie didn't integrate practical and computer FX as well as Fury Road did, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the movie. I love many movies with dodgy effects, like Baahubali, RRR and 80's blockbusters that haven't aged so well like Total Recall. This fact keeps me from giving Furiosa 10 stars because some of those really should have been better.

If you love Mad Max: Fury Road, Kill Bill, and Japanese animation like Fist Of The North Star, you will love Furiosa...but only if you understand the main character of these movies is the wasteland of post-apocalyptic Australia, not necessarily Max or Furiosa.",9.0,1 June 2024
Story Sputters,"""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a predictable, if regrettable, disappointment. It would be wildly improbable that George Miller could top the over the top ""Fury Road"". And maybe coming close to matching that delirious cinematic peak would have felt redundant. But this latest entry in the Mad Max franchise feels worse than redundant, it feels unnecessary.

Oh, there are wonderful post apocalyptic visuals, eye-popping action set pieces, and the cinematic panache that is Miller's trademark. But like the first and third installments in the series, this one gets bogged down in story. And any story that isn't strapped to the front fender of a vehicle hurtling across the Australian outback at top speed only detracts from what we came for: action.

The genius of ""The Road Warrior"" (lucky Americans who were spared the prosaic title ""Mad Max II"") was that it wedded an archetypal hero's journey to a novel milieu and jaw dropping vehicular mayhem. It was a high octane retread of ""Shane"", if not ""The Illiad"". And not only did it offer gobs of kinetic, inventive action, it cleverly deconstructed its Campbellian pretenses without entirely puncturing them. It stands as one of the most visceral, and cerebral, action movies ever made.

""Fury Road"" attempted some revisionist mytholigizing as well, wrapped in nearly unrelenting action spectacle. It was a triumph.

""Furiosa"" flirts with the ""Yojimbo"" model of playing two warring factions against each other, but never commits. But ""Fury Road"" doesn't need ""Furiosa""'s backstory. And, except for marketing purposes, and as Miller's proving ground, ""The Road Warrior"" didn't need its predecessor ""Mad Max"". And did anyone need ""Beyond Thunderdome""'s lame messiah parody? Two out of five ain't bad.",6.0,26 May 2024
Old wine in a new bottle.,"First things come first. Chris Hemsworth has done a good job in the film Furiosa. Throughout his whole career, he portrayed the best character role. That might be the only updated element of this film. Comparing it to Mad Max Fury Road would be like mocking the approach to that film. This movie doesn't offer anything noteworthy. It solely tells the story of Furiosa's birth, her hand loss, and her survival. You could sum that up in one sentence. Furiosa has previously spoken of being kidnapped and raised in Mad Max Fury Road. The movie won't always be saved by the making. The primary issue with this movie is its latency. Certain sequences don't fully convey the characters' nuance and aren't compelling based on their actions. Furthermore, the younger Furiosa is superior to the adult Furiosa. If the script had included fresh material, it might have been better.",5.0,24 May 2024

Visually,"Visually, ""Furiosa"" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning cinematography and elaborate action sequences that are hallmarks of Miller's filmmaking style. The film's use of CGI, while more pronounced than in ""Fury Road,"" has been met with mixed reactions; some viewers appreciate the expansive world-building, while others miss the grittiness of the practical effects used in the previous film.

Overall, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is hailed as a worthy successor to ""Fury Road,"" offering both thrilling action and a compelling story. It might not surpass its predecessor in every aspect, but it stands strong on its own as an epic and entertaining film.",8.0,2 June 2024
Still an epic desert action film - Go see it!,"Despite a third iteration, it still fully entertains you with relentless action and choreography that is top notch. Set in epic desert scenes, it also had its signature extended large oild tanker action. Few seat jumper moments. Some chacters had good lines, but again, the action is poetic!

Story line is similar, but dont expect a pultizer winning novel of story. Just the same story, we all know, but action and similar vehicle designs did not feel old, it just took you to your favourite, familiar place.

Cinematography well done, well edited to make it believable. One of the best summer action movies with a familar oevrtone that is not boring, but connecting. Go see it!",10.0,29 May 2024
Great fan experience,"I saw ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" last night in XD. Wow, a very good film. It is a prequel to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and it to me it was actually better than Fury Road. I know I will get some pushback on that, but I became more invested in Furiosa struggles starting as a young girl thru later adolescence. Add that struggle to fantastic visuals with action scenes related to different strongholds/strongmen and you have a great fan experience. And as always, there are plenty of monster vehicles to add to the fun. The film is well-acted by all, especially Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa. Chris Hemsworth as Dr. Dementus is a bit over the top, but that was intended. Direction and writing by George Miller is very good. Highly recommended, definitely try to see in XD or IMAX. 8/10 (I deducted a couple of points for some continuity errors, but the movie is otherwise great).",8.0,29 May 2024
It's good. Go watch it.,"Furiosa is a great movie overall. I enjoyed it for the most part. Tbh it barely loses out to Fury Road.

Let's start with the good bits. The prequel actually adds lore to the Fury Road universe, by showing us Gas Town, Bullet Farm, more inner workings from the Citadel, War Rigs, and so on. And most of all it does all of this without undermining the legend that is Immortan Joe. It succeeds here thanks to the introduction of a new villain, Dementus who takes much of the blame for her origin story. Hence, it doesn't interfere with or undermine the mystique of Immortan Joe.

The plot is more about survival in the wasteland between different psychopathic parties than actual revenge. Action scenes were great and still managed to add to the world-building.

My nitpicks are few, but annoy me more than they should. This movie creates some time line inconsistencies (mainly thorough 2 scenes) that you have to take mental miles of detours to explain away. They can be explained, but are a poor choice regardless. The movie would've been better without these particular nods to Fury Road.",7.0,28 May 2024

Absolutely blown away,"When I saw that Mad Max: Fury Road was getting a prequel, I had pretty high hopes for it. And I'm glad I just finished watching it in cinemas for the first time because I loved it. This is a movie that has cemented itself as one of the greatest prequels of all time. It takes everything great about Fury Road and amps it up to 11; the visuals, the portrayal of a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland, it's all so incredible. The standouts were definitely Anya and Chris. And man, he must have had a lot of fun going all out with the Australian accent. If you liked Mad Max: Fury Road, this is an easy 10/10. See it on the big screen.",10.0,29 May 2024
Good overall but still disappointing,"Because of how good Fury Road was, I was still very hopeful that this movie would be incredible. And, in general, it really was. Great story, amazing characters, outstanding fight scenes.

The only bad this about it was Chris Hemsworth's (who I usually love) performance. It was so disappointing. His acting always felt way over the top, the attempts at silly comedy bits didn't fit with the rest of the movie and just felt awkward. Overall it really made the movie so much worse than it would've been otherwise.

Incredible performances by Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne, they both killed their interpretation of Furiosa!",7.0,29 May 2024
Boring Story! Action Sequences were excellent!,"Furiosa. Not sure why her story has not made an emotional impact on me. It was boring. Some nutty leader wants to take over the whole business industry with his army and hasn't done anything but harass other characters. I was hoping for some kind of connection with all of it. However one great reason to watch it is the action sequences and how they maneuver the whole game. Other than that, I was quite bored with Furiosa vengeance. Music, cinematography, and Chris Hemsworth were okay. The whole issue was Furiosa was too focused on her being a child. That took forever just for her to grow up. It could have been shortened but I guess the director and studios wanted it that way.",4.0,26 May 2024
"The trailers don't do it justice, just as with Fury Road","I really enjoyed this on the biggest screen I could find. If you liked fury road, this is just a much more deeper look into Mad Max apocalyptic Australia with all the epic car chases, but much longer and better characters. Most will probably prefer the shorter, simpler fury road, I think this surpasses it with equally great action scenes with better drama and better characters. I'm trying to write a short review here but I don't have enough ""required characters"". Yes go see this movie now on the big screen. The first 3 acts are worth it alone. George Miller did what i did not expect, and expand on his world building while creating an even more thrilling, heartfelt story in the desolate, apocyptic Australian outbaclk.",8.0,1 June 2024

The stunning cinematography and exhilarating action sequences are masterfully crafted, making every moment a visual feast.

I'm numb...,"I'm numb from just watching this...

I was worried it would be more of the same from Fury Road.

Hell No! It's a genuine piece of work from Mastermind Miller.

An opera in six parts with so much on offer I will need a few viewings to fully take in what was on offer here,

It was a real leap of faith to make Hemsworth a 'crappy villain' whom is a sublime catalyst for the mayhem on show.

Anya Taylor Joy here for me cements her start status and is a perfect companion to Charlize Theron ( I get now why they didn't use her in the prequel)

Not going to ruin with any spoilers as the story is quite linear which is how it needs to be as you are focussing on the non stop action and not trying to keep up with plot twists...

Go see this absolute Barnstorming Epic on the biggest screen you can!",10.0,31 May 2024
Thrilling And Brutal,"Well, this was 🔥🔥🔥

""Furiosa"" was an epic movie and what a wild ride from start to finish. The film dives into the backstory of young Furiosa, snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and thrust into the brutal world of the Wasteland. I absolutely loved the combination of raw brutality and the unexpected, yet powerful, love story.

The non-stop action and thrilling sequences made it impossible to look away. The world-building in ""Furiosa"" is top-notch, capturing the gritty, chaotic essence of this dystopian universe. It was also refreshing to see Chris Hemsworth playing a villain for once, and he nailed it. The cast overall was amazing.

Yes, it's not ""Fury Road,"" and it didn't blow my mind in the same way, but I still really enjoyed it. The film explores Furiosa's trials and determination to find her way home, and it's an epic journey filled with both peril and hope. If you're a fan of the Mad Max universe, this film is a must-watch. It's packed with action, emotion, and stunning visuals, making it a thrilling addition to the franchise. ""Furiosa"" may not surpass ""Fury Road,"" but it certainly stands on its own as an exciting and memorable adventure.",8.0,1 June 2024
An Unfortunate Great Movie,,7.0,29 May 2024
Best prequel I've seen!,"Director George Miller created MAD MAX 45 years ago, and at 79 years of age, his foot is still firmly on the gas, with plenty of fuel to keep going. FURY ROAD, the reboot from 9 years ago starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron is one of my favorite action movies. The latest installment in this high-octane gas-guzzling franchise is FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA, the origin story of Theron's character. In this, she is played by Alyla Brown, who slowly transitions seamlessly into Anya Taylor-Joy as the movie progresses. As a young girl, Furiosa is taken from her home the Green Place, a place of abundance. She is taken to Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), the sadistic charismatic leader of a gang of bikers. The story is told in 5 stages of Furiosa's epic odyssey. This just might be the best prequel I've ever seen. Not only does it stand on its own, but it also enhances FURY ROAD to even greater heights, exactly what a prequel should do. If I had to compare the two reboots, I'd say that at the time FURY ROAD came out, it blew my mind with its visual effects, non-stop vehicle action, and the unique world. FURIOSA has all of that, and more. It has a compelling backstory that explains why and how Furiosa ends up the way she is. It expands not only character development, but the world itself. This world is inexplicably fascinating to me, with its simplistic names like Gas Town and Bullet Farm, or how there's a certain level of religion towards certain leaders, or even vehicles themselves. The acting is fantastic! This is Hemsworth's best performance. The visuals! I'd be surprised if nobody got hurt during filming; Hats off to the stunt workers. The sound design! Just feeling the rumble of the cars under your seat! There's nothing like it. I might be in the minority, but I believe FURIOSA is even better than FURY ROAD. This could be a movie that makes you think about philosophical questions, OR it could be just a popcorn movie. Either way, you have to see it on the biggest, loudest screen possible. It's a mad, mad world out there, and I'm super excited to see what comes next out of THE WASTELAND.",10.0,29 May 2024
A film made in an artisanal way,"7.5/10 Furiosa is a story about her past. The movie is very advanced in its cinematography, but it still maintains its action like the previous one. However, the action scenes were better in Fury Road. But the difference between Fury Road and this movie is that it is full of political events and a game of controlling territory, which means the film is better in terms of the quality of the story and screenplay. There are two lines in the film, the Furiosa line and the Dr. Dementus line, and everyone has goals, but of course the events of the film bring them together, and I felt that the film was more enjoyable than expected. The last part was certainly enjoyable, but the difference is that the events were heavier in the last part. I kind of felt that this part was more fun and cheap.

As for the acting performance, Chris Hemsworth was certainly the best by far. He is a comical, evil, and random character, but he does not carry anything new that I have seen. Perhaps he does not have to offer anything new at all. Not every actor has to give Ledger's performance with the Joker, but as for Anna Tyler Joy's performance, it was facial expression most of the time, similar to Tom Hardy's performance in the previous part. In short, Fury Road is better in terms of action, while Furiosa is better in terms of cinematography, story, and screenplay.",7.0,26 May 2024

A prequel with little fury,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, so I was eagerly anticipating the prequel ""Furiosa."" Unfortunately, the film feels like it took a typical ""Fast & Furious"" or generic action movie script and applied a visual template to resemble ""Fury Road.""

From the beginning, the narrative drags frustratingly. The story takes numerous twists in an attempt to develop, but it never reaches the expected level of excitement. I think cutting the runtime by 30 minutes would have been a significant improvement, eliminating redundant scenes and speeding up the pace.

The excessive use of CGI became apparent, especially with the noticeable presence of chroma key in various scenes, which detracted from the real and natural feel that ""Fury Road"" managed to convey so well.

""Furiosa's"" story is generic and lacks charisma. There is a notable deficiency in character development, and ironically, despite the film being centered on Furiosa, I left the theater feeling like I knew more about her personality from ""Fury Road"" than from her own movie.

In this production, we spend almost an hour following Furiosa's childhood, with Anya Taylor-Joy only appearing later. Despite her talent, she couldn't shine in the role until the third act due to the limitations surrounding the character writing.

Additionally, I noticed glaring inconsistencies in the timeline and character portrayals. In ""Fury Road,"" Max and Furiosa seem to be around the same age, and Max mentions being a cop before the apocalypse. However, in ""Furiosa,"" the apocalypse had already started when she was a child. This doesn't make sense, as it implies Max worked as a cop during his childhood. Another negative aspect is that this prequel spans several years, yet the secondary characters always look the same, as if the lack of water, poor hygiene, and Wasteland dust miraculously prevented aging.

I felt deeply disappointed with ""Furiosa."" I was expecting a more impactful story that didn't fall into the banality of a generic action film. It reminded me of the case with ""300"": an excellent movie followed by a mediocre and forgettable prequel/sequel. Despite everything, the film is technically impeccable. The cinematography, soundtrack, character visuals, and Chris Hemsworth's performance are standout points, providing some moments of satisfaction.

However, the technical merits couldn't make up for the narrative and emotional flaws. ""Furiosa"" ended up being a missed opportunity to expand the ""Mad Max"" universe in an epic and memorable way.",6.0,26 May 2024
Overhyped and below average,"Anya Joy Taylor seems incredibly lightweight for this part and (even in the quasi fantasy world of Mad Max) is not badass enough to pull of the tough woman role. She's getting off easy in reviews.

Outside of that the plot is very basic and the basic style is Fury Road on repeat, but less stylish. Stunts same, but a bit less real.

The whole thing feels utterly pointless and redundant and though some might enjoy big pointless action movies, there is literally no reason to care what's happening given we already know Furiosas story and Anya Joy Taylor doesn't give a charismatic or compelling enough portrayal to overcome that, nor is the movie fresh or stylish enough to overcome it.

Pointless movie, let it go, Gibson was Mad Max, then the Furiosa story was a interlude in that world, but it's time to let it go and enjoy what already exists rather than continue to make tired revisits to the Australian Wasteland.",3.0,22 May 2024
A masterpiece of storytelling with fantastic acting/ action,"I went into this film as a huge George Miller fan with low expectations since Fury Road was such an epic film, but this one is completely different in a more positive masterpiece of storytelling that is so refreshing it had my eyes glued for the entire 2.5 hours.

The storytelling and the acting is much deeper on so many different character levels that is something that was slightly more narrow in scope Fury which focused primarily on lots of Chase action scenes from Citadel to Green land and back. This prequel does a phenomenal job of world building that it easily leaves the door open to do another prequel or fast forward to next Furiosa which is the exciting part of a genius like George Miller as few craftsman left in the industry that can create these type of masterpieces that each film is an glorious magnificent experience. Witness it!!

The music and editing is phenomenal and kudos to both Ann Taylor Joy for a superb acting job as young Furiosa, and also to Chris Hemsworth who at times you wonder if it's him as he totally transformed into this spectacular evil complex star nemesis with classic ending that easily could have continued to make it a 3 hour film yet no complaints except that we all wanted more at the end and shocked 2.5 hours just flew by which is rare in a film lately - a true classic.

Fury Road was a 9 and this one is a 10 because it is a much deeper storyline and acting and perfect combo of 2 epic films. Looking forward to 3rd one as Trifecta!!",10.0,29 May 2024

Chris Hemsworth is outstanding!,"I enjoyed 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga', which is a rightful addition to the 'Mad Max' franchise.

I personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.

Anya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.

Visually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with 'Mad Max: Fury Road' - which does just slightly edge ahead.",8.0,31 May 2024

Best movie of the year so far... better than dune2 or Kingdom. 8/10. young Furiosa stole show,"I remember watching the first Mad Max (2015) 7/10 and thinking it was mid compared to the hype. The plot felt a little empty. The action was great but it just did not work fully for me.

Furiosa is a different story. Was really engrossed in this film. The action was relentless and kinetic, the plot while simple was well scripted and extraordinarily acted. The chapter system worked really well and felt innovative. The shots and lighting was incredible. The sound (atmos) is pounding wide. See this film in the biggest and brightest screen (imax or dolby cinema) Its a cliche but this movie is like a perfect long roller coaster ride (if you would enjoy a 2.5 hour coaster ride if it was executed and paced really well)

George Miller to pull this film off at 80 is one of the most impressive things i have ever heard of. When you see this movie and how nearly perfect it is you will be astonished especially considering this was done with hardly any vfx.

After seeing Chris Hemsworth in blackhat, I made the determination he could not act. He blew the doors off this part. Really amazing, it was like taking his thor role and making him bizzarro Thor and doing it REALLY WELL. As good as everything in this film is, Young Furiosa i felt stole the show. I really felt sad when she aged in the film. As impossible as it sounds, she carried the whole film threw her eyes and movement. If I were the producer, I would have seen the dailies and immediately make this into two movies with young Furiosa the whole first one.

Really recommend this film. I bet they will give the best director oscar to Villeneuve for dune but george miller without question deserves it.",8.0,23 May 2024
VIEWS ON FILM review of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,,6.0,27 May 2024
Up there with the best of the franchise,"Miller's done it again; another bonkers entry that continues to push the franchise further, with lore equally as inventive as the action. AT-J excels as the fierce protagonist, and Hemsworth disappears into a villain that's sadistic as well as cartoonishly funny; great to see an A - list MCU actor play against type.

I counted three glaring plot holes, and despite being the longest MM by a mile, it's still much lighter on action than FR. But it makes up for it with a meatier story and a heavier focus on creative world - building, and it's as good as any other entry, if not better. Probably should've released 4 - 5 years ago.",8.0,23 May 2024
Sequel syndrome,"Lacks the balls-to-the-wall, start-to-finish madness of Fury Road and overcooks even the best set-pieces, which feel less chaotic and too staged. They went bigger and badder, but the plot makes no sense. Anna Taylor-Joy's surgery-face remains as expressionless as always throughout 99% of the film, although at one point she does open her mouth slightly while looking agitated. Chris Hemsworth's fake nose dominates every scene. In his final scene, he just apes Heath Ledger's Joker as Furiosa lays into him like Batman. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were a million times better. Still watchable, but not rewatchable. They should have at least brought back Charlize!",6.0,30 May 2024
"Crazy, Wacky and Insane. Loved it","George Miller has done it again! An amazing follow up to the insanely good Fury Road.

First of, dont go in expecting fury road 2.0. This is a different tale.. a tale of vengeance, much like the original film.

I found this the most interesting of all the mad max films thus far. We get alot of world building and character development. This is a slow burn at times and I loved it, I just love everything about this universe.

The action is just as insane and crazy with some astounding chase sequences.

Everything about this film is just top notch. The pumping music, sharp directing, gorgeous cinematography and beautiful gritty world design.

A complicated macroeconomy onscreen,"And so we arrive at our ultimate checkpoint: we have transformed what was a fairly simple Ozploitation flick from those drier days of yore into a fully realized Greater Mad Max Saga Universe. The crossover opportunities are ripe, the generative-AI tools are on hand, and we will never have to imagine a world without a Gas Town again. Or Bullet Town. Or Cabbage Town. There must be a Silver Spray Paint Town yet to be depicted, no?

It would require an advanced degree in macroeconomics to fully comprehend the complex business cycles of The Wasteland, but the booms and busts appear to revolve around whether a large tanker of items can make deliveries from one town to another. For example, one tanker of gas might be worth two tankers of cabbage, and one tanker of bullets might be worth two tankers of gas. It is altogether unclear, however, how much a tanker of potatoes might fetch with respect to a tanker of cabbage.

Stuff blows up real good, and road war is waged. Dr. Dementus, who has a Dark Mode, has an endless supply of motorbikers willing to ride hard and fast for a better life, a life with greater supplies of gas and bullets-perhaps also greater demands-for the Law of Diminishing Returns applies to cabbages as well as bullets.

If gas were in such short supply, one would think its consumers would be more parsimonious with its consumption.",7.0,28 May 2024

A great prequel that shines just like it's predecessor,"Once again, George Miller still manifests an insane, crazed, and crazy piece of art with wonderful thrills and action throughout and captivating atmospheres and energy.

Filled with interesting concepts, Furiosa blends not only with action but a coming of age tale mixed with themes of thriller and revenge that are combined with great uses of colorful production, pacing, and character personalities that are entertaining to observe. Provided with great performances from Anya Taylor-Joy and a perfectly over-the-top performance from Chris Hemsworth.

I was left speechless,"The time and patience one has to dedicate their life, in making a lifetime work, coupled with an unquenchable thirst to provide sheer awe and cinematic brilliance technically and emotionally, stands out at every single minute throughout the movie.

Apocalyptic genres are quite easy to enact, since they requite an astute understanding of how humans operate on baseline consciousness. George Miller did a fantastic job at delivering this exact sentiment. I am overall pleased with the aesthetic cinematic treatment compared to its predecessor for continuity and not overdoing with CG.

Dramatic pacing and character introduction is given justice with sufficient screen time to develop their story arcs and finale plot. The wasteland is merciless and spares nobody.

Good but it has its issues,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road one of my favourite action films of all time. Furiosa is good but it has its pros and cons.

What I liked about this film is that is gave us a strong background into Furiosa during her younger years and it builds on the world we saw in Mad Max: Fury Road. It was great to see the towns, biker gangs and of course to witness fun action scenes. It's clear that Furiosa tried to strike a balance between action and story which I usually prefer.

What I didn't like as much was the overuse of green screen and CGI which wasn't always well done and took me out of the film at times. Controversially, I wasn't the biggest fan of Chris Hemsworth's Dr Dementus. Admittedly, I wasn't a fan of Thor since his comedic turn in Ragnarock, nor was I a fan of Jason Momoa's Dante in Fast X and I can say that Dr Dementus fits the Mad Max world much more than those characters suited their worlds but I just wasn't a huge fan of the comedic portrayal of the character.

Overall, Furiosa is a good film and I'm keen to see more of Mad Max world but there were a few things that stopped me from REALLY liking it or comparing it to the first.",7.0,27 May 2024
"As epic as Fury Road, if not better.","""Do you have it in you to make it epic?""

George Miller has once again crafted an action epic worthy of the Mad Max name. Anya Taylor Joy does justice to the role of FURIOSA in this prequel to Fury Road. Chris Hemsworth delivers arguably his best performance as A MAD man hell-bent on gaining power over the Wasteland. The action is dialled up to MAX, with a sequence around the hour mark that might be the best of the franchise, rivalling those of Fury Road. This is a SAGA that deserves to be enjoyed on the big screen.

The ending might not be to everyone's liking as it takes a more grounded approach as opposed to the rest of the movie, but it is what establishes the film as a revenge thriller, a root theme of the Mad Max movies. But before that, it's filled with some of the most outrageous action set pieces and creative vehicle designs you'll see. A great mix of lots of action and some pretty good comedy.",9.0,24 May 2024
One of the best movies of the year and fitting for the genius that is George Miller.,"""Ladies and Gentlemen! Start your engines."" Dementus (Chris Hemsworth)

One of the best movies of this early summer and of the year, that's Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. Co-writer/director George Miller has been here since the Mad Max inception, and while he has become an old man, his movies retain a young man's enthusiasm for ingenious, robust shots, the emotion that parallels them, and the vison of a better world. He's been compared to Sam Peckinpah and Charles Dickens, not bad company.

A prequel to 2015's Fury Road, Furiosa takes its titular heroine (Anya Taylor-Joy) on her odyssey, 45 years after the collapse, from witnessing her mother's execution at the hands of Dr. Dementus to her seeking outright revenge. Along the way are classic Miller chase scenes with souped-up trucks and nimble dirt bikes involved in getting dominance of the ""wasteland"" as this arid piece of Australian desert is called.

Beside the stunning visuals is an emotional subtext that dares to be different from most adventure films. Dementus as tyrant could depress anyone sensitive to current dictators, with the thought that no matter the apocalypse or its time, evil will out. As the dictator with a sardonic attitude and admiral verbal gifts, Dementus is a worthy bad guy, a substantial foe for Furiosa.

Despite the grimy, muscle-bound bad boys. Oil-soaked machines, and arid ""wasteland,"" Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a song of hope for a better world to come while it struggles to preserve what is good about the Apocalypse. Furiosa herself bellows: ""MY childhood, my mother, I want them back."" In the best superhero films, the goal is to reclaim family with a worthy life earning happiness.

George Miller continues to bellow his own vision that moves from chaos and evil to a better world like the cloistered ""Abundance"" that Furiosa seeks to reclaim. Not bad for a future that right now is dominated by dictatorial, self-centered, hedonistic leaders.

If we can fuel our machines, we will eventually seek a ""newer world.""",,25 May 2024
A much needed Prequel to this Epic Saga,"I still remember the headlines Fury Road created back in 2015 by winning all those Oscars and thus making Furiosa one of the most anticipated movies of 2024.

With Anya Taylor-Joy portraying the younger version of Charlize Theron, this back story tells the epic tale of Furiosa's origin. It's still the post-apocalyptic wasteland, but we see the glimpses of Furiosa's mythical homeland where she was taking those female prisoners to save them from immortal Joe.

Though there is not Max (Tom Hardy) this time, Miller gives us another epic character in the form of Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). It's Furiosa vs. Dementus in this prequel that will blow you away with the intense action supported by great soundtrack.

Definitely needs theatrical experience!!!",7.0,28 May 2024
A brilliant prequel!,"I really enjoyed Mad Max Fury Road, for all its high octane action, fast paced action sequences but felt there was holes in the story with Charlize Furon's 'Furiosa' back in 2015.

Fast forward 9 years later, another materpiece directed by George Miller, with a prequel to the back story of our lead caracter in her younger years played out in 5 chapters to her coming of age adult years then potrayed by Anya Taylor Joy, who doesnt speak much throughout the movie but her acting skills makes up for it hugely.

We see how in Mad Max she was taken from the green gardens, lost her arm and a stole 'The War Rig' in Furosia, we get to put the pieces together and understood her being taken to growing in to this fierece wrecking ball of nature, and being intercepted by Dr. Dementus 'Chris Hemsworth' with an interesting look and played with comple arrogance is just great nor forgetting previous arch nemesis and foe 'Immortan Joe'.

Movie is once again fast paced, laced with lots of action, blood & humour, a really good back story with a great cast to fit, seeing it in IMAX is ideal for the big screen for the cinematic experience!",9.0,28 May 2024
"Fun, but disappointing at the same time.","Her name is Furiosa and she was furious. The end.

Let's face it there was no way in the world they could top Mad Max Fury Road in terms of sheer action spectacle, however I WAS surprised that they did surpass it in terms of story.

Set like 20 years or so before Fury Road the story follows Furiosa and how she ended up where she did in Fury Road. I was kinda skeptical going in seeing as a lot of prequels don't hold a candle to the original. But I have to say I was totally invested in her journey for revenge.

While Fury Road had a bit of world building here and there, this movie really goes hard with setting up the world of Mad Max. Whereas Fury Road really only focused on the Citadel. Here they expand on the other locations particularly Bullet Farm and Gastown and how all three are in this tenuous partnership.

After all is said and done this is a straight up revenge plot where Furiosa is trying to get revenge on Dementus who killed her mother and put her in a life of fire and ash.

On that note Christ Hemsworth you could tell was having the time of his life playing Dementus and while I did not really enjoy his character as much as I thought I would. He came off more zany and over the top and a bit of an idiot, instead of the herald of this gigantic post apocalyptic motorcycle gang. Sure they try to explain why he is the way he is, but I just could not take him seriously for the most part.

Still this was more about Furiosa's journey and I think it pulled it off well. Sure there was a couple of plot points that did not make any sense if you thought about it, but this was a movie where dudes spray chrome in their teeth and want people to witness them while jumping off diesels and other moving vehicles. So I mean you know how that goes.

Anna Taylor Joy plays a young Furiosa pretty well and I bought her as a younger Charlize Theron from the first one. However she does not even come in till the hour mark of the movie since the first half is all about kid Furiosa.

I know people were disappointed in the fact that Mad Max isn't a main character in this, however (minor spoiler) there is a Mad Max analog here in this movie who was literally just Mad Max in everything other than name and nowhere near as cool, but he served his purpose.

Now lets get to the elephant in the room which is the action scenes. Fury Road had some, if not the best action scenes in modern cinema. While I did not expect the ones in this movie to be nearly as good. I was honestly a bit disappointed in them for one big reason.

That is the overuse of CG. While Fury Road used CG, it only used it as an enhancement to the actual scenes with real cars crashing and exploding and all that other crazy stuff. Here CG was way more prevalent even in the action scenes and actually took away from the excitement because you knew all that stuff going on was fake for the most part.

I'm not saying the action scenes were bad, they were really exciting and fun, but if you compare the War Rig Scenes in Fury Road to the ones in this...well lets just say it was somewhat of a disappointment. However, the sound was on point, I mean there were times when I really felt I was riding along in the War Rig during the chase scenes.

So in the end I'll say that this overall had a better plot than Fury Road with its fleshed out world and characters, especially Furiosa. And there was a lot of throwbacks and references sprinkled throughout and really bridges the gap on what lead up to the events of Fury Road.

I'm kinda on the fence about this movie as a whole. Loved the story, but was disappointed in the action and this is coming from a big Mad Max fan since the Mel Gibson ones.

Not worth your time,"""Furiosa"" is an absolute travesty that disgraces the Mad Max franchise. The film is a cacophony of uninspired action sequences, a disjointed plot, and poorly written dialogue. Charlize Theron's absence is sorely felt, as Anya Taylor-Joy's performance lacks the gravitas needed to carry such an iconic character. The script does her no favors, rendering Furiosa as a flat, one-dimensional figure devoid of the complexity and charisma that made her a standout in ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""

Pacing is another significant issue; the movie drags on endlessly, with interminable stretches that fail to advance the story or develop the characters. The editing is choppy, making it hard to follow the action or invest in the narrative. The soundtrack, which should be pulsating and intense, falls flat and feels out of place.",2.0,29 May 2024
Mad without Max,"Not entirely true (no pun intended), but you understand what I am trying to do and say here. This plays in the Mad Max universe and world, but tells us the story of Furiosa ... and we do get to see scenes from Mad Max Fury Road during the end credits.

I understand if some people feel we already had a Furiosa movie - with Fury Road. But I think it was more than worth it to have this origin story. Especially with Anya Taylor Joy in the lead ... and Chris Hemsworth being her nemesis. Whom I kind of didn't recognize in the trailers ... the prosthetics team did quite the job on him.

And he goes as over the top as he is allowed to. And then some - Miller who is quite old, does not seem to think about retiring .. I would not be surprised if he does another one ... I actually would love it if he did ... cinematography is just off this planet ... this looks amazing. And while it does not have too many action scenes (in my book), the ones it does have are long and glorious. Imax does help too - the rest of the cast and the story is a bit of secondary. Just go with the flow - quite a bit of violence by the way.

Chris is quite the revelation here too. The first chapter (or is it first two?), feels a bit underwhelming, considering I was expecting way more Furiosa at that point ... but it does make sense with the overall story arc! Really well told and even better showcased ... not for the faint of heart ... but anyone who loves cinema and Science Fiction - well there is no way around this! Another pun? Well Miller was able to make it epic for sure, if you need to ask.",10.0,28 May 2024

Anya Taylor-Joy's odyssey to be an action hero,"Pros:

Anya Taylor-Joy becomes a true action hero with one of her best performances, even without much dialogue, she does a great job acting with her eyes.


Chris Hemsworth plays his unpredictable villain to perfection, delivering one of his most menacing roles to date but adding a human side to his character's scene chewing lunacy.

Best movie this year so far,"Much action combined with a huge depth of the characters portrayed by the perfect actors. Furiosa and Dementus are characters you will think of after watching the movie for some time and be inspired.

The movie is about courage, justice, love, family, freedom, pureness and fairness on one hand side.... And then in many other moments about injustice, enslavement, violence, terror, horror, dehumanization. My heart was pounding without pause in the cinema.

For me the best movie in a long time (happens not often that a post-apocalyptic movie is that good).

Compared to the movie before: Fury road is more a journey with more and more action.

Furiosa on the other hand is feeling like u as a viewer are having those experiences in your own.",10.0,26 May 2024
"Too much story telling, less action","If we say that the movie is based on mad max choronicles, we should expect at least half of its vibe and drive, sadly even though the movie is 2'3h (30min more than Tom's movie) almost 75% of it is just talking, discussing nonsense topics and so on. Come on even the ""final battle/war"" which lasted for more than a month is shown as just narrative & with some blurry cut scenes power-point slideshow images. After all this why 7 and not less? Well, I can't lie, as there were exactly two times 10-15 minutes of times where I felt that I was really into mad max universe and I understand that if not Tom's movie this one would look alike as 9/10 movie.",7.0,26 May 2024

He should've done it in order,"I saw Furiosa tonight and while I thought it was good, for it to come after Fury Road (one of the greatest action movies of all time), it felt a bit weak. Don't get me wrong, it is a good story. And I like how it fills in some blanks about her life and all. But I think it would have been better to simply have made this movie and lead up to Fury Road. That's just my opinion, but what do I know? George Miller is clearly a genius at storytelling, especially about an apocalyptic wasteland.

I willl say that I think Chris Hemsworth gives the performance of his career. We've never seen him like this in anything before.

Anya Taylor Joy is good. Her eyes really tell the story.

Furiosa's life has been difficult, but she gets her justice in the end.",7.0,26 May 2024
Near-Perfect Prequel,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is not as good as Fury Road, but it stands strongly in the franchise. We got a very good character arc for the main character and some interesting original characters. The story was intriguing, the action was great, although not as diverse as in the previous movie. What I loved the most in it was the world building.

Furiosa had a well-crafted arc throughout the film, but my favourite character was Praetorian Jack. He was a little stereotypical, but I liked that. The villain, Dementus was also steretypical, but he still had some very original characteristics.

I was mind-blown by the fact that this movie looked way better than Fury Road. Some shots could've been from Dune: Part Two. Those were my favourite and I liked the look of the night in the desert. The only thing I didn't like was the environment in the very beginning of the movie, it looked very computer generated.

I also wanted to see how Furiosa got accepted in the army as a woman and how nobody suspected she was the little girl, who vanished.

Not as good as fury road, but it's still an amazing action movie and a near-perfect prequel to Fury Road.",10.0,25 May 2024
Furiosa: Film Review,"Exploding into theaters this Memorial Day weekend comes an action thriller from the familiar Mad Max franchise. Written and directed by George Miller, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a prequel to the previous film Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). This film mainly follows the beginning and epic revenge quest of Furiosa (played by in this film Anya Taylor-Joy, previously by Charlize Theron). At the beginning of the movie, we see Furiosa abducted by bandits/marauders under the control of a warlord/wild-man Dementus (played by Chris Hemsworth). After Furiosa's mother pursues across the desert, Furiosa's mother is killed at the hands of Dementus thus starting off Furiosa's fiery revenge tale. Left to her own devices and wits, Furiosa must travel through the wasteland, make allies along the way, and hunt down Dementus to the ends of the earth. One of such allies is played by Tom Burke, a ""Praetorian"" who helps Furiosa sharpen her skills. A classic revenge story no doubt.

For a prequel movie, this story does a better job showing the wasteland world than the previous film. Granted, a good portion of the film takes place in between one of three locations (The Citadel, Gas Town, and Bullet Town). However, being able to see these locations has helped me visualize what the rest of the wasteland looks like outside the Fury Road. The visualization and cinematography in this film helped the film tremendously. All the crazy and madness is captured on film with detail along with the vast desert background. Having the story take place in the desert shows the hopelessness of the situation and the production crew did a great job capturing that.

Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't have many speaking lines, but her vengeful intensity is more-so communicated through her eyes and focus during the action sequences. Chris Hemsworth as a villain may come off as intense, perhaps not in a good way; however, for a Mad Max film, his character works within the story. Tom Burke's character shows up halfway through and comes off as an intriguing character. Not so much as a love-interest (at least not that I can tell), but as a mentor and later as an equal.

Quite the tale to behold; however, I would be lying if I said I have never seen a story like this before. Being that this film is also a prequel it was difficult for me to absorb myself into the story and not predict an outcome ahead of time. Yes, same stories can be retold using the latest technologies and story tactics; however, I confess I don't see a variation in the formula. The runtime of two hours and twenty-eight minutes (exactly) was too long in my opinion. A few scenes could've been cut down, especially in the introduction scenes. Almost makes this movie tamed compared Fury Road. Some parts of this movie slowed way to far down compared to the non-stop intensity of Fury Road.

Overall, the well-done production and good acting will drive this movie forward. Dragging this movie back is the direction of the story and long runtime.",6.0,25 May 2024
Furious vexation,"Directing, visuals, editing : Top notch. It's still managing to be creative and awe-inspiring. BUT it's not as good as Mad Max Fury Road.


8/10.

Writing : This is the weakest point of the movie overall. Mad Max Fury Road drew a lot of its strength in its economy of words. Furiosa takes a different approach, which could have worked... only it didn't. I was embarrassed for the person who wrote some of these lines. The people next to me actually laughed during a scene that was clearly meant to be moving, and I was shaking my head no. Just no. What the hell.

"Another fun, action-packed outback drive","'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga' is the prequel to 'Mad Max: Fury Road', which only seems recent, but actually came out 9 years ago! This film does a great job of adding useful backstory to Furiosa (Alyla Brown when young; Taylor-Joy when a bit older), Immortan Joe (Hulme), his sons Rictus (Jones) & Scrotus (Helman) and how the Wastelands (i.e. Western New South Wales) are controlled by three ""outposts"" - the Citadel, the Bullet-farm, and Gastown. We're shown how Furiosa is captured by motorbike marauders when young and ends up a slave of Dementus (Hemsworth).

Some good Aussie cameos - David Collins (half of The Umbilical Brothers) as Smeg, Dementus' grovelling sidekick, Angus Sampson as the ""Organic Mechanic"", Tim Rogers as one of Dementus' goons and John Howard back as the ""People Eater"". The film sets up well where Furiosa is from, why she's so stoic and why she wants to escape the Citadel. It's also good to see Hemsworth having fun and playing a semi-goofball bad guy, but with a bit of nuance (& a bit of prosthetic nose). Praetorian Jack (Burke) as the war rig driver is also good and has an important part in the final act.

The main star though, is the car chases/stunts/explosions across the desert backdrop, with lots of motorbikes and cars as always, as well as the introduction of the war rig/semi-trailer and some inventive parachuting. Pretty crazy that this film comes 45 years after the original 'Mad Max' and while some if it is of an extreme scale, it's still quite grounded and simple at it's core, with not too much noticeable CGI. The pacing and score are good and the ending is fitting.",8.0,26 May 2024
A wild ride not to be missed,"Furiosa, director George Miller's prequel to the action masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road, throws us back into the desolate wasteland, this time to chart the course of a younger Imperator Furiosa. Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the iconic role, replacing Charlize Theron, and delivers a fiercely captivating performance that's both vulnerable and steely. We meet Furiosa as a rebellious young woman snatched from her idyllic home, the ""Green Place of Many Mothers,"" and thrust into the clutches of the tyrannical Dementus (Chris Hemsworth in a deliciously over-the-top portrayal). In a world where warlords and sandstorms are rampant, Furiosa's struggle for survival and eventual escape turns into a relentless chase.

While Furiosa lacks the white-knuckle, nonstop action sequences that made Fury Road a cinematic adrenaline shot, it compensates with a deeper exploration of its characters and themes. The film is a coming-of-rage story, showcasing Furiosa's transformation from a victim of circumstance into the formidable warrior we know. Taylor-Joy embodies this journey with captivating intensity, her eyes burning with a determination that transcends the need for excessive dialogue. Hemsworth chews the scenery with gleeful menace as Dementus, a perfect foil to Furiosa's simmering anger.

The film's heart lies in its exploration of female empowerment. Strong women are all around Furiosa, from the enigmatic rebel leader to the resourceful young mothers of the Green Place. This focus on female power feels organic within the Mad Max universe, a refreshing continuation of the themes Miller established in Fury Road.

Visually, Furiosa is stunning. The wasteland is rendered in a palette of bleached-out golds and burnt oranges, a stark contrast to the vibrant greens that haunt Furiosa's memories. The practical effects are impressive, with car chases and stunts that feel thrillingly real, even if they don't quite match the epic scale of Fury Road's action sequences. Simon Duggan's cinematography is a masterclass in capturing the vast emptiness of the wasteland, with occasional close-ups that emphasise the raw emotion on the actors' faces.

The pacing of Furiosa does drag a bit in the middle section, and the ending, while thematically satisfying, feels a touch ambiguous. The score, while atmospheric, doesn't quite capture the operatic intensity of Junkie XL's work in Fury Road.

Furiosa is a worthy prequel that expands the Mad Max universe in a meaningful way. The outstanding cinematography, captivating themes, and powerful performances make this film one that stays with you long after the credits have stopped rolling. While it doesn't quite reach the breakneck speed of its predecessor, it's still a wild ride that fans won't want to miss. See it on the big screen for the full visual impact!",8.0,26 May 2024

With strong lead performances by Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne, the very idea of Furiosa herself breathes life into the full 2 and half hour runtime of the movie. Chris Hemsworth also commands the screen in glorious fashion, as does the sound, with an amazing score from Tom Holkenborg.

Fury Road's Shadow Looms Large Over Furiosa,"Furiosa, while boasting a decent narrative foundation, feels overshadowed by its predecessor, Mad Max: Fury Road. The story unfolds steadily, but the film lacks the phenomenal continuity, heart-pounding build-up, and lasting impact of Fury Road.

Sure, Furiosa delivers two fantastic action sequences, but they hold no surprises for anyone who's witnessed the masterful action choreography of Fury Road. Young Furiosa, a character we do root for. However, grown-up Furiosa feels less compelling, and the emotional connection built in the first half fizzles out before a somewhat predictable climax.

Honestly, if Fury Road hadn't set such an insanely high bar, Furiosa might have landed better. But existing in the same post-apocalyptic world, it struggles to carve its own distinct path.",6.0,27 May 2024
George Miller is praised for his artwork of thrilling action in the next film in the series.,"5 out of 5 stars.

Furiosa: A Mad Max saga is an awesome post apocalyptic action film that is a prequel to Fury Road film and more of a epic journey following Furiosas character from her childhood to young adulthood leading to the next film.

It is exciting to see George Millers next film in the mad max saga. Making it seem like there more films that could follow. And yes. I will be there to see more of this stories. Furiosa film delivers the action. Delivers the story. And direction and stunt work are just incredible.

Plot is epic. It follows the 15 years of furiosa until the beginning of Fury Road. Her being taken away from her green place. To meeting a warlord Demetrius (Chris Hemsworth). And her coming across the war boys from Immortan Joe.

The action sequences are exciting and thrilling. The car chases are awesome. The set pieces is exciting giving more of a back drop to gastown. There are a few exciting action sequences. The climax of the film was a little underwhelming compared to Fury Roads epic car chase. Which only involved Furiosa and Demetrius. The spiral downward tanker chase scene was exciting and made up for it.

Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible with the casting choice as Furiosa. And Chris Hemsworth had a great time playing as the villain this time.

The music score was awesome. The cinematography and direction delivered an incredible cinematic action experience.

Uneven pacing takes the shine off Furiosa.,"Given the incredible juggernaut that was Mad Max Fury Road, it appears George Miller takes his bleak dystopian world view a little too seriously. Not that it shouldn't but you have Chris Hemsworth giving a great performance as Dementus, why introduce a half baked character as Furiosa's supposed love interest? Anya is a fantastic actress and she carries the film on her shoulders but to not give Immortan Joe more screen time and relegate him to the sidelines with Rictus and Scrotus(!) is inexcusable!

THANK YOU AGAIN,"George Miller's revemps of the Mad Max universe is insanely great. Amazing but still not as remarquable as Fury Road, Furiosa makes an excellent prequel to the world already brightly set up of the wasteland and the fortress of Imortal Joe in Miller's previous movie. The addition of the gas and the bullet fortress, the character of Dementus and his army and of course the whole background story of Furisoa fit just perfecty into the whole story and psychology of what is really Mad Max : a fight for what is truly right. The plays of Anya Talor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth mixed with the amazing visuals effects, soundtracks, crazy stunts and creative vehicules make the whole universe feels unreal but at the same time so realistic (except some bikes and cars rolling up the 90° degree hills like gravity didn't exist but whatever!). Around the middle of the movie, in the third act, the fifthteen minutes composing the insane chase between Immortal Joe's war rig and Dementus group is defintly the best scene of the entire watch.

"No Doubt, It's the Mad Max Wasteland","In 1982 I experienced the The Road Warrior with a sense of wonderment akin to experiencing the world building magic of reading Tolkien. The gritty, violent wasteland of Mad Max is loaded with Miller's vision. An under-appreciated consistency of how brutal the competition for scant resources is. Loaded with colorful characters that despite moments of levity make you believe and root for a hero (or anti hero, or a strange fusion of the two).

Even without the title or recent experience of Fury Road, you could sit in your seat and at first viewing just know that this was a Mad Max movie, sans Max.

Another great feature is how this fits in with the 2020's annoying feature of filmmakers feeling the need to make the movie at least 20 minutes too long. Yes, this is a long movie. But instead of hoping I would get to the end and get to go home it kept my interest throughout.",9.0,28 May 2024

An epic origin story with lots of disappointments.,"Rating is 8.5/10 Watched on May 27th, 2024 (first watch) Format: IMAX theatre

A well made origin story and prequel of one of the best action films ever. Furiosa is a very interesting character that a revisit of her story and past was a must and a need and would have been not fair to not be told.

However, this film is unfortunately missing so many elements that prevented it from being close to Mad Max: Fury Road's (2015) level. Firstly this part missed the dramatic element or the dramatic connections between the story and the audience. For instance, taking a look at the Green Place was such a disappointing scene that had nothing in it as I was really looking forward to the visuals that this place had to present. Moreover, I wish if the film spent more time with Furioso's mother to perhaps increase the sympathetic element towards her character.

Something that surprised me is how this part chose to completely change the vibes, environment, and colors of the world of Mad Max. In this film, everything seems lighter and brighter comparing to the darkness that was presented in Mad Max: Fury Road which I would have preferred to be continued in this part. Moreover, the color pallete and cinematography in this film was a bit disappointing and underwhelming. Nothing special or unique like Fury Road. At times, the very bad visual effects can be seen clearly which made the watching experience very much annoying at times.

On the other side, Anya Taylor Joy as young Furiosa is for sure a perfect casting choice that I would have not been able to see anyone else to relive Charlize Theron's performance better than her. At times i felt like Chris Hemsworth needed a little more push. Except for the last scene of the film in which he was given all the attention and focus into his character's philosophy and way of thinking, which was interesting and very good way to conclude the film.

I really wanted some scenes (especially the action sequences) to be shot using IMAX cameras as it would have made the watching experience 10x better and it would have hit different and a made a big difference as the Mad Max story needs to be told using the biggest aspect ratio.",8.0,28 May 2024
Interesting but overlong with mixed performances,"Interesting, sometimes wonderful settings, then: very artificial looking. Actress of young furiosa is the highlight of the overlong film. Anna was a good fit. But Chris Hemsworth is a strong contender for the Razzies next year. I felt like he was in another world. Over the top is great for Mad Max (Hail Homungus) but this goofy guy wasn't threatening, not funny, not impressive... way too important. I would have preferred more of immortan Joe. Overall too much explaining, a thing Fury Road handled way better. The action was a bit of a copy of copy... Chasing the big truck: mad max 2, mad max 4... too much repetition. Would have love to see more of the 40 day war. Didn't get why the shortened it so much but gave good Thor so much space. Anyway: the 4th best mad max after road warrior, fury road and the original mad max.",6.0,3 June 2024

Medium-octane action,"Less music. Less CGI quality. Less silence. Less octane.

Would I rewatch it? Most likely no. Would I recommend it? Definitely yes. Just keep your expectations lower, it's not Fury Road, sadly.

I'm a fan of the Mad Max universe, so getting another movie to build the universe further is great for me.

I would recommend going to a 4DX cinema (with moving chairs). This adds another dimension of action to make up for vastly missing soundtrack.

I'm waiting for the next movies in the franchise and I'll watch them no matter how good or bad they are.

I AM FURIOSA!,"Finished to see the movie the only word that came to my mind was WOW. I can say that this is one of the best prequel of all time, i can say that this story can stand on his feet also without fury road and that is cool as much fury road, if not more.

George Miller's style in this is at is peak.

While watching the movie you can Tell that you're watching something that is unique, despite this franchise its 45 years old. With things like this you can see the talent of a great director and Miller didn't disappoint.

Anya-Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth performances were both beautiful.

On one side we have the brave Furiosa reprised to perfection and doesn't make you regret at all the beautiful performance of charlize theron. On the other side we have the incredible surprise of the Dr. Dementus of chris hemsworth. As an actor he as always been talented but with this one he literally explode in a performance that is funny, weird, frenetic, hateful and represents the peak of his career for the moment.

"One of the best visually stunning and ""vroom"" sound effects","Mad Max Saga, Furiosa: One of the best visually stunning and ""vroom"" sound effects you would have seen on Dolby Atmos.

The cars and chariot like motorcycles are displayed with pure human motions in a unique way- whether it's anger or rage.

The location in a desert like Wasteland, Gasland and other areas are projected in a different manner.

George Miller's (Director) storyline is good, and the screenplay is well projected from the start to finish. Editing could have been little crisp and could have shortened the movie by 20 mins.

Anya Taylor steals the show with her expressions and rage, displayed magnanimously through the unique automobiles.

Chris Hemsworth does his usual best with his uncanny attitude and gestures.

It contains everything you could have wanted it to contains if you liked the last movies. Coherent world building, tears, jokes, actions, etc...

"Furiosa is a mere spectator in this show, just like the rest of the us.","A competent prequel to Fury Road though not entirely satisfying. Very thin on the storyline and that should have been the POV when going back in time to see what made the characters they went on to become. Action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and some of the stuff has never been seen before but dare I say it feels the glut of action sequences is to hide the wafer thin story and little character development. Hemsworth is having a gala time playing Demented. However, he comes across as more cartoonish than unhinged.

Enter the Halls of Valhalla,"Considering the high bar set by Fury Road, any spin-off would have to be utterly brilliant just to match it. While it doesn't come close to the 2015 classic, it is a fine movie on its own terms.

There are several problems holding it back from being a true classic. First, it's very much tied to the last film. The Mad Max series has always been separated from each other, with George Miller comparing it to classic mythological tales. So it's a bit odd for longtime viewers to see another Mad Max story so closely related to another.

Second, a problem inherent to any prequel is how to make tension when the ending is already known. We know Furiosa won't get home and we know Dementus won't take over, so it takes a lot of tension out of their stories. Plus it makes a big deal out of the origin of several things we don't really need an origin for like the War Rig and Furiosa's shaved head.

And finally, the pacing is off. It's the longest in the series, but a lot could be cut out. The prologue before Anya Taylor-Joy's Furiosa appears is far too long and should've been maybe ten minutes. There's also long periods with no action when all four previous movies kept it going. But those are mostly minor quibbles to the rest of the story.

Miller has always been great at world building and this one expands on previous film brilliantly. We see much more of the Citadel and it explores the Fury Road, Bullet Town, and the Bullet Farm.

Furiosa is an engaging protagonist, and this does an excellent job fleshing out of her character. Dementus makes for a terrific villain in the vein of Toecutter or Lord Humungus. He's smart, devious, dangerous, and fun to watch.

Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth are both amazing, and the movie's worth it just for them. She balances channeling Charlize Theron and making the role her own. She does a lot with just body language and looks. Hemsworth is an excellent villain, knowing exactly how much scenery to chew. This proves he can do so much more than the handsome hero.

Tom Burke is a pleasant surprise as Jack, a kind of Proto-Max. Just like Mel Gibson and Tom Hardy, he can do a lot with a little to develop his character. Lachy Hulme does an admirable job as Immortan Joe, but no one could match the late Hugh Keays-Byrne.

The movie looks amazing. It's well shot and the graphics are well done. Though there's none of the iconic shots of Fury Road. Plus there's a lot more obvious CGI when the series has always been lauded for its practical effects, even though the CGI looks good compared to so many other big budget movies.

The action scenes are great. The biggest set piece occurs about halfway, but each one is well done. Again, none of it comes close to Fury Road but it's right alongside The Fall Guy in terms of fun and spectacle.

It will suffer from comparisons to its Academy Award winning successor, and it's a bit of an outlier compared to the rest of the series. But it's another argument for going to the big screen for the spectacle.",8.0,28 May 2024

Surpassed my expectations,"I'll start this by saying I was going into the cinema not completely sure what to expect. Needless to say the movie absolutely was top tier, everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack, to the acting.

It had a decent story line that paired well with Mad Max Fury Road. I think the stand out was indeed Chris Hemsworth, he stole the show in my opinion, played a perfect villain.

Overall left the cinema stoked with what I watched, I even went home and watched Mad Max Fury Road, and I might be leaning in favor of Furiosa as my favorite of the pair.

Great things, hope Miller continues soon.",9.0,26 May 2024
2 fast.... 2 furiosa?,"When it was announced that George Miller was making a kind of Mad Max reboot with Tom Hardy.... Is was like.... Hmmmmmmm

Then Fury Road came out and it was BLEEPING AWESOME.

Cut to like 8 years later.... And news comes out that they're making a prequel to fury Road... All about young Furiosa and I was like.... hmmmmm

and then it came out and it was....... MEH

So it's a prequel to 2015's FURY road, FURIOSA tells the story of ... a young Furiosa (Charlize Theron's character in FURY ROAD)

The movie acutally opens with audio exceprts from news stories that give you little snippets of the world as it starts to turn into the wasteland post apocalyptic world of Mad Max that we know .... theres not too much and its pretty vague (in a good way) to give the audience jusg a few wee nuggets of info.

We then meet young Furiosa as a 10-12 year old, she's in the Green Place (mentioned in Fury Road) but no sooner to we meet her, she's abducted bua couple of goons who kidnapp her and take her to their Leader.... DEMENTUS (awesome name, more on the names later) played to perfection here by a scene stealing / chewing (delete as appropriate) CHRIS HEMSWORTH

He's the leader of a gang in the Wastleland, he keeps young Furiosa in the gang DEMENTUS' gang crosses paths with Immortan Joes gang (from Fury Road) and as part of a craxzt trade deal, Furiosa is given to Immortan Joe

That sets the movie and its story more or less,,,, what follows is a series of wasteland gang squabbles between the Citadel (Immortan Joe's place), Gastown and the bullet farm (all briefly referenced in FURY ROAD), while Anya Taylor Joy's FURIOSA does some growing up on her way to becoming Charlize Theron.

I think its almost impossible to talk about Furiosa without comparing it to FURY ROAD, so I'm not even gonna try.,

I think the inherent problem with prequels is, you know the outcome of the story (more or less). You know certain characters will live (Furiosa, Joe etc) and you can probably guess certian characters die....(no spoilers!) eno And the problem with making this specific prequel is,,.,, its a prequel to a modern classic. Fury Road was (IS!) a PHENOMINAL movie. It topped the list in many critics and publications best movies of the decade, and I think Empire named it best movie of the century....? (hmm)

So, while ANY George Miller directed Mad Max movie is a welcome thing, I think most people would have wanted a SEQUEL to Fury Road, not a PREQUEL. It could still be a Furiosa led movie (I mean, Fury Road was a low key Furiosa led movie anyway,,,, seriously, Max is a passenger in the story and plot of Furiosa)

But yeah, a sequel to Fury Road would have been prefferable,

I think it was James Dyer in the Empire film podcast put it best when he talks about in Fury Road, we meet Furiosa as a fully formed character already., With very little dialogue or exposition, we get who that character is, what shes about..... we don't really NEED ther back story fleshed out.

When you explain away the mythlogy.... it takes away from the MYTH..... ology..,...

CHARACTERS / ACTING

Anya Taylor Joy does an admirable job as the young Furiosa, looks wise you can see how that person grows up to be Charlize Theron so there's no disconnect on the surface level, and she handles the various scenes and states well enough. Buuuuuuuuuut,,,, the whole time I was thinking to myself.... couldn't Charlize just have played young Furiosa in this movie?

As I said before, Hemsworth kinda steals the show here. He walks a fine line between over the top crazy bad guy chewing the scenery, and nuanced tortured past bad guy.

Like theres some subtle things he does in the movie, that kinda hint towards the fact he maybe doesn't WANT to be the crazy, murderous gang leader.... but the events of the world and of his surroundings have forced him into this role,..,.. and he has to play that role to survive (kinda reminded of Jeffrey Dean Morgans portrayal of Neegan in The Waling Dead in that sense.

Speaking of sense.... the sensible thing to do at this point would be to subscribe to the channel 😏

The supporting cast are pretty good also, the various henchmen and lieutenants of the gangs are wonderfully weird and brilliantly named (History Man, Organic Mechanic, Rictus Erectus, Scrotus to name but a few)

I don't want to go off road into spoiler territory, but theres a character that appears halfway, ends up being an important character, both to the story and to the character of FURIOSA, but it feels like they're introduced too late, the the relationship isn't earned.... the stakes of the relationship don't feel high.... so we don't care as much as I think the filmmakers would like us to.

One of the things that stands out with Furiosa (and all Mad Max movies) is the dialogue. The world of the wasteland has evolved from the world we know, and so has the way people speak.

Its very subtle but the slightly different way the characters speak to each other, the odd cadence of the their speech, the word swaps that feel like they've used a thesaurus, it really helps to sell the other worldly ness of this reality.

Tonaly, it's pretty spot on, nothing seems out place in that respect, its avery believable apocalyptic wasteland.

It seemed to be quite a lot more CGI, heavy than Fury Road, was The scenes at the end that show you know show you clips of Fury Road. Kind of remind you of that and it kind of just reminds you of how much better. Uh, a movie Fury Road.

Where this movie falters, is in its pacing, and structure,

Where Fury Road clocked in at just under 2 hours, Furiosa tips the scales at almost 2 and a half hours.

Fury road was essentially a relentless, don't stop for anything 2 hour chase movie (with plot and character development peppered seamlessly throughout)

Fursiosa is much more (delibately) slower movie,. Its even split up into 5 or 6 chapters with accompany titles (that are wee bit pretentious,,,,, kinda reminded me of Zack Snyders Justice League and early Tarantino... we don' need the chapter title cards guys, just get on with the movie)

Theres plenty of action scenes so its not like its a dull snoozefest (DUNE 2!), but its definitely a slower movie than Fury Road

There s sequence about halfway through the movie t hat feels VERY much like callback / homage to Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior

CGI

The look of this film is much less gritty than Fury Road, and it feels like there was a lot more (Obvious) CGI in Furiosa.... theres a couple of shots that really stand out .... and not in a good way...

Don't get me wrong, at times it looks stunning, and I'm sure the 4k disc of this will no doubt look AMAZING..... but it did feel a little video game ish.... a little AVATAR ish.... and not the grittyness that we expect from the MAd Max Wasteland Universe.

Similarly, the score by Tom Holkenborg (FKA Junkie XL) is more subdued than his (AMAZING ) score for Fury Road

(I actualyl LOVE the score for Fury Road, there a track on the Fury Road score called Brothers in Arms which made its way stratight the top 10 movie score tracks on my playlist)

Gonna go with 6/10 for Furiosa, perhaps I went with too high expectations and was wanting more of the FURY ROAD type of movie... so If you go expecting a Fury Road type.... you might be little dissapointed.

But as I said, I'm happliy see any George Miller directed Mad MAx movie.... even one without Max.",6.0,28 May 2024
Rushed Storyline with unexplain connections,,2.0,25 May 2024
Makes fury road even better,"Movie is done in chapters, which I usually enjoy, and I felt each chapter got better as the film progressed. I didn't think much about the word ""saga"" in the title at first, but it truly does tell a story spanning many years. I loved seeing how this dystopia functioned as a society. The whole movie is a blood-rushing epic spectacle that adds to the Mad Max lore while being a visual marvel with its stunning dystopian desert set pieces.

I liked that kidnapping the girl wasn't easy. It shows how much people and their morals have changed, with a girl willing to die to keep her home safe. The sound of the motorbikes, with the deep grunts of the engine reverberating through the theater and vibrating the seats, was a pretty cool feeling.

Chris Hemsworth looked like a biblical character when we first see him. He plays a character so insane and with such a major role in the movie that we get to see him fully explore his madness. It's one of my favorite performances from him, he's almost unrecognizable as Dementus. He seemed to have a blast playing the character. The chariot was cool. Anya Taylor-Joy, like Charlize Theron, felt like a contrast to the crazy wasteland and action, giving stoic performances and conveying emotion through her eyes.

Something I hate is when a character tries to save someone by sacrificing themselves, only for the person they're trying to save to come back and make their sacrifice pointless. It pisses me off so much.

The scenery was epic, with a desert that never ends. Gastown and Bullet Farm looked like pretty cool dystopian cities. There was a lot of warfare, and I loved how creative it was. It's reminiscent of Fury Road in its imaginative approach to combat, car chases, and war. They came up with some pretty inventive contraptions, and it was amazing to watch these machines at work.

All the actors playing Furiosa were great. Although Anya was the most talked about, the others were amazing too. I was genuinely impressed by Alyla Browne. She was in ""Sting"" (2024), which I thought was horrendous, but she did so well here. It took longer than I expected to see Anya Taylor-Joy, but she was great too. I wasn't too sure about the casting at first, even though I think she's phenomenal, because I don't usually think of her as an action star.

This movie had more story and character arcs than Mad Max: Fury Road. I loved the way Furiosa loses her hand; it was always going to be a pivotal moment in her life, so it had to be done well. Some scenes felt visually reminiscent of Fury Road. It's been a while since I've seen quicksand. I like that the movie is vibrant, a trait from Fury Road, because most dystopics are usually dark and gritty.

I love that all the leaders were as smart as they were cruel in terms of warfare. They could have easily been depicted as generic villains, not so smart. But we saw that they were all worthy foes.

The story made sense, explaining how Furiosa ended up working for Immortan Joe and her revenge story. It makes Mad Max's depiction of Furiosa seem even more painful; after everything she went through, to then find out the Green Place doesn't exist. That's what I love about this movie-it adds so much to the already near perfect Fury Road. That's what prequels should do.

It's different from Mad Max because it has a more developed storyline and character arc. Mad Max was just straight-up action: drive into the desert, take a U-turn, and come back. There isn't much talking; Furiosa isn't much of a talker, but towards the end, she and Dementus have a back-and-forth, and I thought it'd be better with less talking. Some of the dialogue worked; some of it felt meh.

My favorite characters were young Furiosa and Dementus. Dementus because he's insane and fun, and young Furiosa because you learn about what she's lost, what she's done to survive, and what motivates her.

This is my second favorite movie of the year after Dune: Part Two. I love it because it makes Mad Max: Fury Road even better. Furiosa is an example of epic filmmaking, a character-driven epic that builds on Fury Road's wondrous insanity. This year has been great for action and sci-fi movies with Dune: Part Two, Boy Kills World, The Fall Guy, Civil War, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Monkey Man, The Beekeeper. We'll be getting Deadpool & Wolverine soon. Unfortunately, we still got Lift and Rebel Moon Part 2, but we can ignore Netflix lol.",8.0,27 May 2024
The BEST Mad Max movie of them all,"I loved it. There was more psychological and emotional conflicts than in Fury Road and more clear examples of the Predator mentality when resources become limited. The action and special effects had less of a cartoon ambiance and there was more reality to the plot. This is possibly THE BEST Mad Max movie.

With the current global conflicts, Furiosa also illustrates what just might happen if and/or when the predator mentality of some countries becomes the dominant controller of politics. What is critical towards world peace and happiness is NOT the available resources but how they are used in symbiosis with other sources of resources. When a country or source of resources has a win/lose (predator) attitude what results is a lose/lose relationship for everyone.",10.0,3 June 2024
An enjoyable look at Furiosa origins.,"It's almost as good has Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), going back to the story Furiosa, and how she became the fearless warrior, and the wasteland of a ruined society.

The movie in spots can slow down a bit, but when action scenes come, believe me they really come. Anya Taylor -Joy fills the shoes of Furiosa quite perfectly, so did the actress playing Furiosa as a young girl.

"Move over Postmortem Joe, Lord Dementus is in town!",I liked this movie. Lord Dementus stole the show. Chris Helmsworth (who is nothing short of a genius) played Lord Dementus. Nothing is really said about the past of Lord Dementus but he was the enemy of Postmortem Joe. The humor of Lord Dementus was funny also. Lord Dementus was always making funny comments. It's almost as if it was dark humor. I really liked the dynamic between Furiosa and Lord Dementus. At first I thought Lord Dementus was going to be cruel to Furiosa but he saw her as his own daughter. But I am curious about the orgins of Lord Dementus. Where did he come from? What is his backstory? It's not really explained in the movie. I hope Lord Dementus get his own movie. Like a prequel.,6.0,27 May 2024
What Walt's Watching,"""Furiosa"" is the best origin story of this decade!

Don't even try arguing with me.

In nearly 2 and 1/2 epic hours (the longest Mad Max film ever in 45 years of the franchise) the renegade warrior ""Furiosa""(Anya Taylor-Joy ""The Menu"") back story is laid bare.

This is before her encounter and team-up with Mad Max (who can be seen in one very cleverly edited shot played by Tom Hardy's stunt double Jacob Tomuri).

The British-American actress, Anya, is a huge fan of the franchise and her character long before she put ink to paper with the genius director George Miller (seriously no-one does spectacular like him except maybe another Aussie, Baz Luhrmann) and now she is literally playing in the same sand box as Charlize Theron.

Miller fell in love with Anya's acting and screen presence in ""Last Night In Soho"".

George believes any actor, like her, already trained in dance has a big head start for nailing movement on an action film set.

There's a tip for young players.

Meanwhile, Christopher Hemsworth was attracted to the role of ""Dementus"" because of the poetry & rhythm in his language...plus he gets some of the best lines in ""Furiosa""...not that there are many lines because the director's mantra is ""words slow down an action movie"".

""Dementus""costume is no accident because it was inspired by dictators and conquerors throughout history.

The last and only other time I've seen Hemsworth this charismatic and unhinged was in ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" (also a great movie) and very Charles Manson inspired.

Chris endured fours in the make up chair everyday for this role.

Once you get past the initial shock of his prosthetic nose, teeth, wig and beard you just see the rise and fall of this warrior bikie leader and ignore the physical traits.

Don't worry the muscles are still there.

This is no dad bod Thor!

Aussie audiences can play spot the Aussie with everyone from Hemsworth, Lachy Hume as the new ""Immortan Joe"" honoring Hugh Keays -Byrne's who died 4 years ago, John Howard & Angus Sampson to David Field, former rugby league legend Ian Roberts and a fellow voice actor Lee Perry respectfully replacing the late Richard ""Rick"" Carter as ""The Bullet Farmer"".

Thank goodness George, his cast and crew had it in them to make ""Furiosa"" epic from start to finish including the vehicles, stunts, sound design, script, narrative, vistas, story arc and editing.

""Furiosa"" fills in the blanks from ""Fury Road"" (2015) about ""Gastown"", ""The Bullet Farm"", ""the Abundant Place"", ""the Citadel"" and so much more!

She is that thing.,"The origin story of Imperator Furiosa where she is snatched away from her home by biker raiders and her mother chases after them to get her back as well as to ensure that biker raiders don't reveal about their place of abundance to others. Furiosa is taken to Dementus who wants to take over her home. On their way, Dementus eyes for the Citadel and years pass by with Furiosa growing up, prepping for her freedom as well as her revenge. How does she exact her revenge, forms rest of the story.

Narrated in chapters, visually the film is top notch despite minor CGI glitches. The narrative is captivating and the violence delicious in particular. The linear story telling helps here and Furiosa is a character the viewers are already invested in, thanks to the fabulous Fury Road. The film does get slow paced during chapter 4 and 5 but it is made up for by the stupendous Chris Hemsworth towards the end, with his quirky dialogues. The action scenes were definitely more enjoyable on the IMAX screen and George Miller excels again with his direction, needless to say, nobody else can do justice to the world he has created in this franchise.",7.0,23 May 2024

Did not notice much IMAX at all. You will get to see Gas Town and the Bullet farm in depth which I was very thankful for....the roads were not as much as a character as FR...you actually knew the route and recognized the land marks in FR, where Furiosa has a much bigger map!

"Stars out slow, then hits on all cylinders","As ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" (2024 release from Australia; 145 min.) opens, we are introduced to Furiosa as a little girl, maybe 6-7 years old. She ends up bein stolen from the Green Place (later also referred to as the Place of Abundance), and Furiosa's mom gives chase... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this movie serves as a companion and outright prequel to 2015's ""Fury Road"". In ""Furiosa"" we learn all what happened that was briefly referred to in ""Fury Road"". ""Furiosa"" is structed in 5 separate chapters. The initial 2 chapters are frankly too long for their own good. When the third chapter arrives, about 1 hour in, we now get young (late teens/early 20s) Furiosa (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) and coincidentally or not, the movie immediately picks up pace and finally feels what we've come to expect from a Mad Max movie: insanely tense and over-the-top vehicle chases of all kinds, with correlating violence and fights. Chris Hemsworth is okay as Dementus, the main bad guy. And Mad Max? He is nowhere to be found. He was already reduced to a secondary character in ""Fury Road"". Given the strong character that Furiosa has become, I can't say that Mad Max is missed all that much.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" opened this Memorial Day weekend, and was a box office disappointment (only $32 mill over the 4 day weekend). The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well (maybe 20-25 people in a large theater). That does not bode well, considering that just the production budget (meaning not counting the marketing budget) was about $160 mill. ""Furiosa"" is currently rated 90% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels a little generous to me. In a way, it is the victim of its own success. ""Fury Road"" was so staggeringly good on so many levels (an both commercially and critically) that nothing could ever live up to that. This is not to say that ""Furiosa"" is not a good movie. If you are a fan of the Mad Max franchise, I'd readily encourage you to check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,28 May 2024

There was nothing interesting in the ""stunts,"" vehicles, characters or plot that made me want to sit for another 2 hrs. What makes it more disappointing is that George Miller did Fury Road, so I know he can do top-notch work, but this was just lazy movie making. The green screen/CGI was so jarring and used so lazily that it detracted from everything else going on (there was even a shot of 2 rifle casings on the sand and *THAT* was CGI, couldn't even be bothered to have the 2nd unit shoot that.)

Excellent Prequel to a Movie I Hated,"I know, I'm one of maybe two people on earth who hated Fury Road prior to last night. And I felt that way because Fury Road, for me completely lacked context. There was no explanation as to why Furiosa was where she was in her life in Fury Road, and we got a mere 90 seconds of Mad Max being taken prisoner as background before the action popped off. So I found the whole thing to be a form of visual and auditory gratification with no substance.

This film, Furiosa, however, gave me everything I was missing for Fury Road. It's an epic tale with emotion, background and most of all, a plot. There are some, um, I'll say disappointing visual effects at times, which is surprising to me for a George Miller film, but the sound mixing and cinematography are top notch. The sets are beautiful. And holy hell, this is easily my favorite Chris Hemsworth, Hemi as I call him, role to date.

Anya Taylor-Joy naturally has that dead serious stare that works perfectly for this role, and while she has very little dialogue, she pulls off a dynamic performance mostly through expression.

Without giving a spoiler, there is, for me, a moment in this film that was worth the entire price of admission, when all the VFX and sound is stripped away for an impactful moment between characters that ironically amplifies the entire experience.

When all is said and done, I have a much greater appreciation for a movie a previously loathed and I will watch this installment over and over.",8.0,25 May 2024
Furiosa BETTER than Fury Road,"Fury Road is great but Furiosa (in my opinion) was just a little bit better. This movie was well written and well directed. The story is superb and the pace is ""on point"". From the very beginning until the very end - this movie was freaking awesome. There were some slow parts for certain specific reasons and some fast parts for some hard core insane action scenes. Nothing looked stupid or ""over the top"". I never rate movies a 10 but this movie was a 9.5. Every single actor/actress played their part to perfection. This movie was a treat and well worth the extra money I spent for the ""big screen"" showing and D-Box seats. This is how a movie should be made. A+++++",9.0,27 May 2024
Nothing like Fury Road,"And by that I don't just mean the inferior actors or the lack of eye candy. It was mostly the tempo, if Fury Road is like heavy metal than this one is like smooth jazz lol and it fades out in the end. It did look like they tried tho. The effort and the budget was there I'm guessing but it wasn't very inspired. Chris Hemsworth is too funny and Anya Taylor Joy is too weird for this saga. The intensity and the raw charisma of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron was a big part of what made Fury Road special it seems. Well the one thing I like about this one is that it made me rewatch Fury Road twice in one weekend lol I appreciated it even more also Nicholas Holt was also great in it and the eye candy was top notch. Not to mention the high octane non stop action and the sick soundtrack. Furiosa is okay by 2020s movies standarts still a bit of a let down. Especially towards the end.",7.0,27 May 2024
"Not as good as Fury Road, but still epic","Furiosa is a prequel, an origin story and some excellent world building in the world of Mad Max.

The film follows the trials of Furiosa from a young girl to the start of Fury Road. The action is suitably epic. Some of the shots are more obviously CGI or studio shot than Fury Road, but even so, this is way better than the CGI-overload that most sci-fi/fantasy films are these days.

Chris Hemsworth is channelling his inner Jack Sparrow (if Captain Jack was a psycho cult leader). It was strange to find myself rooting for Immortan Joe.

Some of the story developments don't make a whole lot of sense if thought about too much, but that has always been the case with Mad Max.

Thank you George Miller, for showing the rest if the industry how it is done.",8.0,25 May 2024
Furiosa: The Road Warrior,"Mad Max: Fury Road definitely set the bar higher than ever for Mad Max films of the future, but Furiosa does a great job of staying on pace and making it a great prequel to watch in the future leading into 'Mad Max: Fury Road"". Furiosa's journey from a little brave kid to a road warrior is one of the coolest stories for a spin off character ever. The way she lost her arm was justified and sad as well, but one thing that I was sad about was how much green screen went into filming. It made sense to do it at times, but the thing that made Mad Max 1-3 standout to me (including Fury Road) was the practical effects and ridiculously awesome car designs. Chris Hemsworth does an amazing job as the villian of the story and Anya Taylor-Joy is truly FURIOSA!

ALSO, WOULD LOVE TO GIVE BIG SHOUTOUT TO CHARLIZE THERON WHO GAVE US FURIOSA'S VERY FIRST APPEARANCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AMAZING CHARACTER! HOPEFULLY SHE WILL RETURN FOR A FUTURE MAD MAX PROJECT!",7.0,27 May 2024
One of the best films of the year - see it in IMAX (now)!,"FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA (2024) **** Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Alyla Browne, George Shevtsov, Lachy Hulme, Charlee Fraser. George Miller's ongoing dystopian future saga incorporates the prequel origin story of its titular heroine (first Browne as a child and then Taylor-Joy as a young woman) who endures the kdinapping of deranged 'leader' Dementus (Hemsworth getting in touch with his inner Josh Brolin having a field day) while tangling with the equally demented Immortal Joe (Hulme, imposing as ever) over the barren wasteland's precious resources with nothing but vengeance and redemption in her sights. Taylor-Joy, boasting the most expressive beautiful eyes today in cinema, digs deep and dirty with a gritty and stoic turn holding her own with the action at hand, while she doesn't exactly resemble Charlize Theron, she does have her laser focused gaze and stance down pact. Bold, aggressive and abundant in scope, execution and some truly amazing set pieces guaranteed to leave your jaw-dropping, pulse racing and heart exploding. Must see in IMAX or the next best thing onscreen.",10.0,31 May 2024
An enjoyable movie but it doesn't quite live up to Fury Road,"Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action movies ever made. I have been craving for another Tom Hardy sequel for years! I understand that because of the lawsuit with WB is the reason why the sequel still hasn't happened. For now, we have a prequel concerning Charlize Theron's character, Furiosa, from Fury Road. Is this a worthy entry in the Mad Max saga?

One enjoyable thing about the Mad Max films is that they all feel very different. Furiosa is no exception. It is a very gang-driven, political and revenge-filled story. We get a lot of world-building on how the Wasteland is operating with all its factions. Seeing the political tension between the previous villain Immortan Joe and the new villain Dementus is very engaging. It is also interesting to see a calmer and smarter Immortan Joe. I also like that we get to see what ""The Green Place"" looked like as we only got tiny mentions before. The prequel story also successfully expands more on how Furiosa is where she is by the time of Fury Road. By the end, I do sympathise with her more.

On that note, Anna Taylor Joy does a good job as a younger Furiosa. She doesn't have much dialogue but she does great through facial and body performance alone. Chris Hemsworth is the highlight of this film though as the villain Dementus. He is clearly having a lot of fun and does a great job of hamming it up. His villainous speeches are thoroughly entertaining! The rest of the supporting cast do a wonderful job as well but special praise to Lachy Hulme as a younger Immortan Joe. He does a terrific job living up to the previous actor Hugh Keays-Byrne. One of the most important things of a Mad Max film is the action and there is certainly a lot of it. Every action set piece is a marvellous spectacle with its over-the-top violence and incredibly well-made wasteland vehicles.

Unfortunately, the action scenes here just aren't as great to look at as it was in Fury Road. This is because the CGI and colour grading are just not that well done in Furiosa. Fury Road did a majority of the action practically while CGI was used subtly to enhance the movie. Furiosa has a fair amount of action scenes that are not done practically. We have action set pieces that are entirely CGI or scenes that contain lots of green screens. These CGI are very noticeable and can pull you out of the movie. The colour grading is just orangey for the most part and looks way too clean for an apocalyptic movie. Visually, Furiosa just doesn't look as nice and the cinematography never quite mesmerises me.

Junkie XL returns to compose the music for Furiosa. His score for Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most amazing things ever. However, his music score is so incredibly underwhelming in Furiosa. It doesn't help that the action scenes are oddly silent when they would greatly benefit from an epic soundtrack. Junkie XL feels wasted this time. The movie also lacks the kinetic and fast-paced editing that you would expect from director George Miller but here it just feels generic. The movie is also 148 minutes long (28 minutes longer than Fury Road) and you definitely feel it. There are a fair amount of moments where the pace is quite slow and the last 20 minutes of the movie does drag a bit.

Overall, Furiosa is still an enjoyable movie but it doesn't quite live up to Fury Road. Still, it is impressive that George Miller was able to make this when he was nearing 80 years old. I am still looking forward to a Tom Hardy Mad Max sequel that will blow me away again because Furiosa doesn't quite do that.",7.0,25 May 2024
Horrible movie made for the short minded.,"Title says it all if you enjoyed this trash I would recommend seeing a specialist for your mental illness. Never again will I decide to watch a movie based on the reviews of the masses. Either this is getting botted reviews or I am extremely out of touch with what good a movie should be.

I even sat through the whole thing when I all I wanted to do was turn it off after about 40 minutes. Ill give it this the action was decent enough and the art/design of sets and attire was very well done and probably enough to keep most people entertained, But if you can overlook the editing and acting because of just those then I applaud you for that!

I will add as a side note I am disappointed to see people review this over a 6 to then have so many negative things to say in their review itself it really is just sad to see.",2.0,1 June 2024
WHAT DUNE 2 TRIED TO BE....OR MAYBE FURIOSA IS JUST THAT GREAT LOL,"I was hoping dune 2 wouldn't be boring but it was pretty draggy in some parts, whereas Furiosa is Sick, awesome, bloody and EPIC...never boring...the trailer and promotion made it seem passable and cliche, but oh my gosh This film was great! Too good for it's own! Fury road was awesome, but i love this film! It came off as a Fury Road and 300 mashup! The visuals are very out of this world and every shot is just nurtured into greatness just like 300, although furiosa has much better greenscreen and special fx...This film was just great. I had no idea it would be this good, not a dull moment, and some horror elements are definitely seen here. If you thought FURIOSA would be boring and weak, like I mistakenly did, then you are WRONG...must see, will probably be remembered just as much as Fury Road is! Summer blockbuster and an INSTANT CLASSIC.",10.0,25 May 2024
About as close to perfect as an action film can get in virtually every regard,"Just saw ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"", the fifth film in the ""Mad Max"" film franchise that serves as both a spin-off and a prequel to 2015's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Once again directed and co-written by George Miller (""Lorenzo's Oil"", ""Babe: Pig in the City"", ""Happy Feet"") and starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, it is about as close to perfect as an action film can get in virtually every regard.

In a post-apocalyptic Australia, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from her home in the Green Place of Many Mothers by members of a large Biker Horde. The Horde's leader Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) tries to extract the necessary information about Furiosa's origins, but she remains tightlipped throughout her ordeal. For failing to cooperate, Dementus then executes Furiosa's mother right in front of her and later decides to adopt her as his own surrogate daughter. Over time, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) works her way up through the ranks of Dementus's Horde, eventually becoming a valuable asset to his entire team. One day, Dementus's Horde stumble upon a large citadel operated by the ruthless Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), whose refusal to give up dominance results in a large scale war erupting between the two factions. Amidst the chaos, Furiosa finds herself fighting back against various enemies from both sides, all while trying to navigate her way back home to the Green Place.

Decades ago, many unsuspecting international audiences were first treated to the world of Australian cinema through the ""Mad Max"" series. This set of films, which follows the story of the wandering nomad Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), has since gone on to become one of the most influential post-apocalyptic forms of media, attracting a loyal fanbase worldwide. In 2015, the belated fourth film in the series ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was successful in bringing the franchise back into public relevance after a 30 year long absence. One of the most notable supporting characters in ""Fury Road"" was Furiosa, a tough-as-nails amputee played by Charlize Theron who teams up with Max (Tom Hardy) to bring down their mutual enemy. Nine years later, Furiosa's origins are told to us in ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"", which not only works as a great action film on its own, but also as an excellent study of the title character's motivations and the situations that moulded her into the fierce warrior she was forced to become.

Taking place several years before the events of ""Fury Road"", the film introduces Furiosa as a naive young child living among the inhabitants of the utopian Green Place. In this idealistic paradise, Furiosa lives a peaceful existence with her mother, remaining blissfully ignorant of the apocalyptic conditions that lie beyond her familiar home. However, Furiosa's innocence is soon shattered after she is kidnapped and used as leverage by a Biker Horde, which in turn becomes her first real exposure to the outside world. After she refuses to help their leader Dementus, he cruelly forces Furiosa to watch as he kills her mother, never allowing her to shut her eyes throughout the whole process. It is here the film begins to show us the interesting relationship between Furiosa and Dementus, with the two taking on the roles of adoptive daughter and authoritative step-father, respectively.

As she grows older, Furiosa works hard to adapt to the harsh environment she is subjected to against her will. Since this is a world where fuel, food, weaponry, and even basic human intellect are hard commodities to come by, proving yourself useful to the specific group you belong to is the most important asset for survival. For instance, to prevent herself from standing out as a woman among a crew of mostly men, Furiosa shaves her head bald, becomes selectively mute, and masquerades as one of the male Horde members using a cloth to cover most of her face. But most notably, we see how she has become desensitised to the brutal nature of her new reality, often staring death in the face multiple times.

Over the course of Furiosa's time in the Horde, Dementus develops something of a paternal fondness for her. After forcing her to watch him execute her mother, Dementus offers the young Furiosa the gift of a plush toy rabbit that once belonged to his biological daughter, hinting that he now considers her part of his close family. Naturally, Furiosa rejects this gift, refusing any kind of comfort from the man who murdered the one person that mattered to her the most. Nevertheless, Dementus recognises the young girl's resilient nature, later using her as a crucial member of his Horde as they conquer and annex other settlements throughout the wasteland. Unbeknownst to Dementus, Furiosa is secretly planning her own revenge plot, biding her time for the correct moment to bring him and his Horde to their knees.

In addition to this engaging story, the film also contains plenty of the signature vehicular chase scenes the series is known for. George Miller frames every one of these fast-paced action sequences like they were crucial to the plot, and not a single second of them went to waste. All kinds of vehicles ranging from high octane motorcycles, large fuel trucks, and even parasailing scooters rush through the desert at top speed with precision that even rivals ""Top Gun: Maverick"". The stunt work is also commendable here, with characters leaping to and from vehicles with only a matter of centimetres driving a wedge between them and certain death. According to producer Doug Mitchell, one of these stunt sequences actually took 79 days to shoot properly, which is quite incredible the more you think about it.

Visually, the film also features some gorgeously shot scenes that immerse the audience in the atmosphere of this post-apocalyptic world. Whether it's Furiosa standing silhouetted among the landscape of the empty wasteland or the clever framing of Dementus as some kind of deity, the cinematography makes it easy to feel like you are a part of this story where basic human civilisation has collapsed. One shot I particularly loved was when Dementus's large convoy are invading another settlement and the camera zooms out to show how isolated this sizeable encampment is from other inhabited colonies. The sheer size of the location juxtaposed with how insignificant the Horde looks in comparison reminds the audience of how much work will need to be done if humanity were to rebuild after such a cataclysmic event.

Taking over from Charlize Theron, Anya Taylor-Joy does a fantastic job stepping into the shoes of Furiosa, one of the best written female heroes to grace cinema screens in a long time. Though Furiosa is a character of few words, Taylor-Joy's ability to act using her facial expressions and body language are able to speak more than any verbal dialogue ever could. There are so many instances where you can see the pain in her eyes as she endures one hardship after another, yet she painstakingly fights through it all despite how much it hurts. Her struggles draw comparison to other notable female film heroes, like Ellen Ripley from ""Alien"" and Sarah Connor from ""The Terminator"", in that we can actually see her grow as a person throughout the course of her suffering. Other film studios should take note that this is how you're supposed to write a strong female character, by putting her through real, believable challenges and learning how to come out on top in the end.

As the villain of the story, Chris Hemsworth is highly effective in the role of Dementus, who seems perfectly tailored to a character like this. I really enjoyed watching how Dementus is able to maintain control over his followers, to the point where he is even worshipped by some members of his Horde. He does this by instilling a sense of fear into others while simultaneously maintaining a level of respect towards those he can find some use for later. It is through Dementus's relationship with Furiosa where he starts to show his softer side, viewing her as the daughter he never had the chance to see grow up. Hemsworth previously played a manipulative cult leader in 2018's ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" so it's not too much of a stretch to see him portraying a character like Dementus, who has similar objectives.

Being a ""Mad Max"" film without Mad Max, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" deservedly earns its place as a fantastic addition to the franchise by reminding us all of why this series has remained so popular for over four decades. It finds ways to explore the already established universe with a completely different character but without ever disrespecting the original hero in the process. I would be more than happy to see Furiosa's character in other ""Mad Max"" related media, as there is potential for her story to continue beyond this one and ""Fury Road"". Personally, I think it would be in George Miller's best interests to redirect his focus back to the series' namesake, since there is even more of his story that still needs to be told. Regardless, the future certainly looks bright for both Miller and the ""Mad Max"" series as a whole.

I rate it a very high 9.5/10.",10.0,23 May 2024
Mad Max part five,"I am not particularly a fan of the ""Mad Max"" films and the only one I really liked before this one was ""Mad Max Fury Road"". But this one is truly outstanding and the best mad max movie I have ever seen.

Director George Miller has done it again and created an excellent action movie with superb cinematography from Simon Duggan who did ""The Great Gatsby"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" directed by Mel Gibson.

""Furiosa a mad max saga"" is just as beautifully made in all departments as ""Mad Max Fury Road"" which was nominated for ten Academy Awards including best picture and best director and it won six. This film is equally worthy of that kind of recognition.

The best thing about the movie is the star making performance of Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa. She makes you care about her character with just her body language and her eyes and not much dialogue. She gives the best performance by an actress in an action movie since Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"". And Chris Hemsworth is great as the bad guy.

""Furiosa a Mad Max Saga"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Go see it!",10.0,24 May 2024
Fury Road's Worthy Prequel: A Must-See on the Big Screen,"George Miller returns to the wasteland in fiery glory with ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"" a prequel that expands the world of his masterpiece ""Fury Road"" while carving its own unforgettable path. This isn't just a retread; it's a thrilling origin story that deepens our understanding of the enigmatic Furiosa and delivers an action-packed spectacle demanding to be seen on the biggest screen possible.

Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the iconic role with a fierce conviction, portraying a younger Furiosa hardened by a brutal past and fueled by an unyielding desire for freedom. Her journey is one of relentless pursuit, both physically as she navigates a treacherous landscape and emotionally as she grapples with the trauma that shaped her. Taylor-Joy embodies Furiosa's strength and vulnerability, making her a character you root for with every fiber of your being.

The action sequences are pure Miller magic. He crafts ballets of vehicular mayhem, each chase a masterclass in choreography and practical effects. The desert explodes with fire and fury, leaving you breathless and awestruck. But the action serves the story, propelling Furiosa forward and showcasing the desperation and ruthlessness of this post-apocalyptic world.

Miller isn't just interested in spectacle, though. He crafts a rich tapestry of characters, from the menacing warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth, deliciously unhinged) to a band of rebels who offer a glimmer of hope. The world-building is phenomenal, further fleshing out the lore of the Mad Max universe with distinct factions and a palpable sense of decay.

""Furiosa"" isn't without its emotional stakes. The film explores themes of survival, loyalty, and the fight for a better tomorrow. It's a story that resonates on a human level, making the action all the more impactful.

This is a film that demands to be experienced on the big screen. The immersive visuals, the bone-crunching sound design, and the sheer scale of the action sequences will leave you speechless. Whether you're a die-hard Mad Max fan or a newcomer to the franchise, ""Furiosa"" is a thrilling, beautifully crafted cinematic experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",8.0,24 May 2024
A new chapter in the wasteland.,"In 1979, the Australian B film Mad Max became a huge global hit and that also meant the big breakthrough for Mel Gibson. The trick was briefly repeated by writer and director George Miller in 1981, resulting in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, which is still considered the best film in the series by hardened Mad Max fans. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome became the third and final part in 1985 and was tackled in a big way at the time, even with a role for Tina Turner in the film. That's where the Mad Max- trilogy seemed to come to an end and it would be. Until in 2015, thirty years after the third and final film we were surprised with Mad Max: Fury Road. This time Max was not played by Mel Gibson, but by Tom Hardy and the film was a huge success. In addition to Tom Hardy, we were seen Charlize Theron as Furiosa, a hard-hard woman trying to survive in the desert ravaged by bizarre figures. Now Furiosa gets its own film within the Mad Max saga, only Theron does not return as Furiosa, but the baton has been handed over to Anya Taylor-Joy, who broke through with the Netflix series The Queens Gambit. Next to Taylor-Joy, we see Chris Hemsworth as the in and in bad Dementus. What we expect is actually just like in Fury Road, an adrenaline roller coaster ride with lots of action and circus stunts.

In that regard, Furiosa does not surprise for a moment, because as a viewer you indeed get exactly what you expect from the film. The film is a prequel on Fury Road and literally fits seamlessly with that film. The first about 45 minutes of an hour is spent on Furiosa's childhood and how she is captured by Dementus at a young age. Dementus wants to know at all costs where Furiosa comes from to be able to plunder that place, but Furiosa keeps its lips together. Eventually they end up with Immortan Joe, where Dementus eventually has to give up Furiosa and more or less has to make a deal with Immortan Joe in order not to be completely erased off the card. The whole childhood of Furiosa might have been told in a shorter time frame, because the film lasts a good two and a half hours and although the film is not really bored or anything, it could have been maybe twenty minutes to half an hour shorter. The young Furiosa is also played by Alyla Browne, who actually plays the role fine. After seeing the childhood of Furiosa, you finally know why she is the way she is and what her motivations are. Well, the entire Mad Max saga, including the old movies with Mel Gibson, does not excel in the story, because that is simple, straightforward and you would almost say of secondary importance, because what you come for is the freak show and the circus stunts that you are eventually presented with.

Actually, it's mainly Chris Hemsworth who really manages to excel in the film. Where Anya Talor-Joy plays a great role as Furiosa, Hemsworth really knows how to own the role as the in and in bad Dementus. Incidentally, the film reminds here and there that it has become a kind of mild reboot of The Road Warrior from 1981. Dementus is reminiscent of Humungus, but without a Hockey mask, Gastown looks a bit like the ford being defended in The Road Warrior and especially the attack on the truck with fuel is very reminiscent of The Road Warrior. The best scene of the film is when Furiosa goes along with Praetorian Jack and fights with The War Rig. The scene takes quite a long time and at that moment we see the action again as we got to see it in Fury Road along with the most bizarre and dizzying stunts that come with it. Although this is really a very cool scene and offers top entertainment, the feeling of 'been there, done that' was very much, because it really looks like a repeat of moves we got to see in Fury Road. That's not a bad thing, but it does ensure that the real wow effect stayed away from me, something I certainly had at Fury Road.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga offers entertainment from start to finish and won't be bored anywhere. Still, it does not justify the enormous playing time of two and a half hours and should have been cut in the first three quarters of the film. Here and there the film makes it feel strongly like The Road Warrior from 1981. Certainly the scene where Furiosa has to defend the War Rig together with Praetorian Jack is really top entertainment, but strangely enough, the real wow effect is gone and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga mainly offers repetition of Fury Road. Anya Taylor-Joy does fine as Furiosa, but it's Chris Hemsworth as far as I'm concerned who really steals the show as the in and in bad Dementus. For the rest, Furiosa is a nice addition that is just beautifully made and above all knows how to entertain. Still, it is to be hoped that the already announced Mad Max: The Wasteland as the title still reads for the time being, is better and will bring back the wow effect. Either way, Furiosa is definitely worth a trip to the cinema because it is and remains popcorn entertainment from the top shelf.",7.0,26 May 2024
A masterpiece of modern cinema,"I'm struggling to think of a film franchise that is spread over 40 plus years and that remains consistently entertaining and gripping, other than the Mad Max saga. In fact. To call the Max movies a franchise is doing the films a disservice. There's always a sense that Miller is making the movies because he has a story to tell.

Furiosa is simply epic - I'm sure this word will be used a lot to describe it. From the moment it opens, there's a feeling that you're in safe hands. You strap yourself in and prepare for the ride!

Alyla Browne is a compelling young Furiosa. I lost track of time watching the film but her scenes seem to take up a good chunk of the overall movie, and are excellent. When the transition to Anya Taylor-Joy occurs, it's natural and there's no sense of a jarring change in the lead.

I think Furiosa hits harder than any previous installment in the series. There are scenes of brutality and mean spiritness that make the behaviour of the original Toecutter and crew appear almost tame.

All the cast are excellent. Chris Hemsworth plays against type as Dementus, and is a fantastic baddie. Taylor-Joy is always watchable and is hardly recognisable beneath her grease paint and dirt splatter.

The soundtrack is by Tom Holkenborg and it continues the themes and pace of his Fury Road music. It's an exceptional soundtrack.

Furiosa: The darkest avenging angel of the Wasteland,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga Directed by George Miller, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is the latest prequel to the critically acclaimed ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). Miller, known for his direction of other hits like ""Mad Max,"" ""Mad Max 2,"" and ""The Madness of Max,"" once again demonstrates his unparalleled skill in crafting a gripping, post-apocalyptic narrative. While ""Furiosa"" may not surpass the sheer brilliance of ""Fury Road,"" it successfully adds depth and emotional resonance to the saga.

An action thriller at its core, The movie captivates audiences from start to finish. The film is replete with intense car stunts, unrelenting violence, and breathtaking action sequences. However, it's more than just a showcase of mad action; it weaves a compelling story with stunning visuals and proper connections to the prequel. The journey of Furiosa's characters , adds a significant layer of emotions to the narrative.

Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a stellar performance as the young Furiosa. With minimal dialogue, her expressive eyes convey a wide range of emotions, from righteous anger to deep sorrow. Her portrayal of Furiosa's transformation from a captive of the Green Place of Many Mothers to a formidable warrior in a desolate wasteland is both inspiring and powerful. She stands as one of the strongest and inspiring female figures that bollywood has offered.

Chris Hemsworth, as the warlord Dementus, departs dramatically from his usual heroic roles. His charismatic yet brutal portrayal of Dementus is a revelation, making it hard to believe he is the same actor who plays Thor.

Tom Burke, as Furiosa's love interest, brings a charming depth to his character. His beautiful eyes and subtle performance create a captivating on-screen chemistry with Taylor-Joy. The young girl who plays Furiosa in her early years also delivers an impressive performance, despite having limited dialogue.

The movie is set against the backdrop of expansive sand dunes and a dystopian wasteland, brought to life with exceptional CGI. The visual effects, particularly portraying the sand dune and war scenes, are remarkable and enhance the film's immersive quality. The new war rig, a monstrous and seemingly invincible vehicle, is utilized to great effect, becoming a crucial element in the film's action sequences.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a visually stunning and emotionally charged addition to the Mad Max franchise. While it may not eclipse ""Fury Road,"" it offers a richly layered story with strong performances, particularly from Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller's direction ensures that the film is not just a feast for the eyes but also a gripping narrative journey, making it a must-watch for fans of the series and newcomers alike.",7.0,24 May 2024

I really wanted to like it...,"But it just didn't get there. It was always going to be hard to follow Fury Road, but I thought it was possible. This, unfortunately, felt like the kiddie version of a brilliant film. I felt there was too much unnecessary and obvious CGI. The characters, other than Dementus, were too many, underdeveloped and therefore uninteresting. I did like the younger Furiosa, but Anya Taylor Joy didn't fit for me as anything approximating what Charlize brought. I loved the quiet, visceral, brutal emotion of Fury Road. It was in the script, in the cinematography and in the silence and sound of the score. I just didn't find that here. Yes, there was lots of action, but none of it added up to a good story. I kept waiting for it to end. I kept hoping Fury Road would never end.

Fury Road was a simple story, told beautifully with color and sound and singular purpose. Furiosa was a complicated tale told in too many chapters with not enough connection to its reason for being.",5.0,26 May 2024

Remember Furiosa?,"My birthday weekend was a blast and it was a lot of fun! On my birthday weekend yesterday, I finally got the chance to watch Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, and it was pretty epic and also action packed thrill ride!

George Miller clearly knows how to bring Wasteland to life and the so many incredible warriors and the most badass characters in the movie! He maybe 80 years old, but for sure tho, he still brings a Mad Max Saga to life on the BIG SCREEN in IMAX!

Anya Taylor Joy, played Furiosa so brilliantly and she has done an incredible job with her part, and Chris Hemsworth has brought has best performance as Dementus! They both did such a great job bringing a Mad Max saga to life along with a mastermind of filmmaking: George Miller!

21st century spaghetti western set in the wastelands of the 22nd century,"The initial trailer for ""Furiosa"" was on a level of its own and the movie itself lives up to it. There's a chaotic frenetic quirky energy to George Miller's original ""Mad Max"" series and the creator and master of this unique genre delivers again with an origin story that echoes Max Rockatansky's own story of loss and revenge. But less we forget: the setting for Miller's movies is a world at its worst. This is the wastelands, a grim, wretched, unforgiving place generally devoid of civility and civilization. And that, for me, is the glimmering idea in Miller's fantastical action-packed foray and the very reason for ""Furiosa"" for even existing: from a world descended into barbaric hopelessness, warriors for hope persist, be it Max Rockatansky or Furiosa or Praetorian Jack. Hope, from the ashes of a hopeless situation, fueled by Mr. Miller's inimitable swashbuckling vehicular manslaughter style, and nurtured, sustained, maintained, willed into existence by broken albeit indomitable individuals, is the theme of Miller's movies, whether we realize it or not. It's a banger of a film, and more uplifting than a movie set it barren apocalyptic wastelands has any right to be. How about that.?",9.0,26 May 2024
Great installment,"I don't get why people slept on this film on opening days; proves people these days have no taste because of streaming. Sad it took a pandemic for society to give an excuse to make more money by releasing fresh movies from the factory on platforms rather on the big screen.

I think it is a worthy addition to the franchise and while Mad Max Fury Road, I think this one stands on its own as one action movie for the decade and imo my favorite movie this year besides Dune II.

Chris Hemsworth and Anya Taylor Joy knocked it out of the park nailing there performances though Charlize Theron's Furiosa is undoubtedly iconic i really enjoyed how Anya flawlessly captured Furiosa's ra(n)ge demonstrates Anya Taylor Joy is one of the best actresses of our generation also Chris Hemsworth plays an iconic villain; charismatic yet cruel psychopathic cult leader and also the actor Tom Burke is an underrated actor whose do for more public exposure.

"More of the same, but not bad","It's a good movie with fantastic action scenes and decent acting. As much as I love the Mad Max franchise and George Millers movies, this has the curse of a Prequel written all over it. You know how it will end, you know who will survive (and who's not), and that's a bit of a problem when it comes to tension and raising the stakes. This movie also does not add much to the world of Mad Max and Fury Road, it just plays with already established characters and places. But when it comes to action scenes, oh boy, it delivers to the fullest. Particular one scene in the middle comes to mind where we see a fight around the rolling warrig, wich is just pure fun to watch. Great stuntwork is again the real motor for this movie and makes it so spectacular on the big screen. If you just want more Mad Max, it delivers finest Fanservice. But it's not much else, it builds upon the strengths of its . Predecessor. So, I enjoyed it, but not as much as Fury Road. 7.5/10.",7.0,25 May 2024
A mostly justified prequel,"Furiosa is an amazing origin story with fantastic action, amazing performances and immersive visuals.

The world of Fury Road was explored so briefly, with the characters rushing past all these interesting settings only made minor reference to, and this film incredibly explores further into the locations of the Bullet Farm, Gastown and the Citadel. Chris Hemsworth and Alyla Browne were absolute stand-outs, especially Hemsworth's unhinged villain Dementus. Anya Taylor-Joy was really good but I feel like her performance got very much overshadowed by Hemsworth. The action was no where near as frequent as in fury Road, but it held up with new and innovative apocalyptic techniques to attack in pursuits, which was very impressive considering there were a lot more CGI effects this time around.

Moreover, the CGI didn't distract from the movie entirely but it was very much noticeable and more obvious than it was in Fury Road. Tom Burke kinda comes off as a dollar store Max but it didn't seem too blatant. And the relationship between Furiosa and Immortan Joe didn't feel as fleshed out as Fury Road made it out to be, especially given how this movie ends.

Overall, aside from being a slightly more than mediocre prequel, Furiosa is a visual and technical wonder, and comes very close to being a masterpiece mostly due to the incredible performances from the two leads.",8.0,25 May 2024
"Persistent, yet flawed by a smidge","I was prepped with hype and chaos for George Miller's ""Furiosa"" upon arriving at the cinema. Upon leaving the building, I thought ""The second sand film of 2024 (first being Dune: Part 2), that gives a merit to my eyes, except this one does not reach fully cogency.

Heavily disciplined Anya Taylor Joy rides out to Outback Australia to work under the thumb of native George Miller for a prequel of ""Fury Road."" Anya plays young Furiosa who gets abducted by wastelanders while she fends for herself. She comes of age in the wasteland, and she learns the ways of her kidnapper while playing a servant and secretly seeking revenge on those who foiled her.

George Miller has made a substantial amount of pictures that are shot in widely open areas that tell us his fast paced action in these areas are the best place for him to reach his every nuance.",7.0,25 May 2024
an incredible spectacle sequel,,8.0,25 May 2024
An unexpectedly excellent chapter in the Mad Max saga!,"From the humble 1979 original B-movie that birthed many late night showings, to some entertaining sequels of questionable quality, to 2015's truly amazing Fury Road, the Mad Max franchise has somehow gotten more mileage out of its tank than many of us might have thought possible. Often films that build upon such a character and his exploits tend to drift downward over time, as the idea of storytelling takes a back seat to the pursuit of profits. This is not the case with Furiosa, a follow up that equaled and may have arguably surpassed Fury Road.

As a prequel it manages to explore the origins and motivations of Praetorian Furiosa and in a brief blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo pay homage to our titular hero Mad Max while ending in a manner that seamlessly merges with the events of Fury Road. Immortan Joe, his War Boys, and the surrounding cadre of hangers on are revisited and more fully fleshed out. We see more of The Citadel and the Wastelands, being introduced to Gas Town and Bullet Farm, building more of the surrounding world than ever before. The only thing left out was any mention of Barter Town, but as we know, two men enter, one man leave, so perhaps that one man simply wasn't interested in spreading the word.

Anya Taylor Joy is admirable in portraying the character of Furiosa, first brought to the screen by Charlize Theron. They were equally believable and equally good playing Furiosa at different times in her life. Chris Hemsworth is almost unrecognizable under a huge prosthetic nose, affixed in such a manner as to allow him to chew the scenery and make us aware of how much fun he's having. Tom Burke is a surprise and did a fantastic job as the secondary male lead who teaches Furiosa how to survive runs across the Wasteland in the War Rig.

There's a 20-minute single cut combat scene that I cannot do justice to. It's one of the best nonstop action sequences you'll ever see with constant surprises that will redline your adrenaline. You'll want another sequel as soon as it ends - Shiny and Chrome, Witness it!",,24 May 2024
Intense Undercranking,"George Miller has used a particular filming technique in his previous Road Warrior movies. He will capture the action with the camera running at a slightly slower speed. Then, when the footage is played back at normal speed, the action speeds up. This technique is called undercranking. The drawback is that sometimes the way people move quickly looks unnatural, ""Charlie Chaplin-esque"" in the way characters zip about. There were moments where this seemed to evoke some laughter from the audience. Something I'm not sure Miller wanted in those scenes.

As I mentioned, Miller has done this filming technique before, but as far as I can remember, it wasn't as obvious, at least not as obvious as it is in Furiosa. What Miller has perfected in these films are the intense pacing of the action scenes. There are some spectacular stunts that if were featured in some other action flick, it would be shown from several angles in slow motion. Not here. This is quite the assault on your senses as the relentless action is accompanied by a pounding soundtrack.

The female lead is the young version of Charlize Theron's character from ""Fury Road"". What a great job of casting. You really can believe this is a young Theron. The stunts in this movie certainly top anything seen in the Fast & Furious franchise or John Wick. You have to hand it to the action scene designer for coming up with some thrilling scenarios with some interesting wrinkles. Such as a big set piece located in a quarry. Another is our heroine grappling under a speeding semi-truck, nearly making contact with the spinning truck tires, making repairs while repelling boarders. Also worth noting is the intricate production design and cinematography. Going hand in hand, there are grand images of machines and structures against a desert background that are iconic.

As you may have heard, the action quotient for Furiosa tops Fury Road, which was also all action. There are more motorcycles and motorized hang gliders, adding another dimension to the type of stunts we are given this time. As for the casting, Chris Hemsworth works well as the charismatic villain. There are many other supporting characters that have their unique look, primarily with full body tattoos. The one exception is the truck driver, looking like the familiar Mad Max character. In this case, he is an actor I'm not familiar with. However he fulfills the role of the fearless road warrior just as well.

This movie fleshes out the backstory presented in Fury Road, and one could argue it is more interesting than the story in Fury Road. Both films have their moments, and Tom Hardy was perfect as Max, and Theron was his perfect foil. Here, it is Furiosa as the hardcore rebel that ultimately wants to get back to her homeland. Anya Taylor-Joy plays her with unrelenting intensity, reminding me of the lead in ""Hanna"", very smart with superb survival skills. I would say that ""Fury Road"" has a more satisfying ending, and I have to raise a yellow card for Furiosa clocking in at two and a half hours. Even with the sped-up action, there was just a bit too much. Part of that comes from numerous chases of one character after another.

But yet I am not complaining really. Sure some of the CGI was obvious, but not distracting. It is a far more original blockbuster movie for this summer than anything. The extended Road Warrior universe is worth the extra time, despite the slightly comical undercranking.",7.0,25 May 2024
Miller loses the plot with mediocre Mad Max spin off...,"Not sure why this latest Mad Max spin off (prequel) is getting such high marks - in reality it's an absolute crock.

Basically it's a dumbed down mirror-image of 'Fury Road' without the thrills and star power of Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy to carry it through the wanton wasteland.

While the film's cinematography and sweeping desert landscapes are worthy of praise, the many ott, over-long CGI action scenes actually detract from the same old Mad Max storyline of bad vs badder in pursuit of power and greed.

The biggest draw back though is that none of the characters are particularly likeable so we are unable to engage emotionally or indeed root for any of the main protagonists. Miller's direction is haphazard and lacking in humor while the amount of extreme 'zoom ins' he uses throughout is literally laughable.

An almost unrecognisable Chris Hemsworth chews up the screen as the main bad guy while a brooding Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa just scowls her way from one explosive fight scene to the next. The final showdown between the two is an absolute let-down, which ultimately sums up the whole pointless excercise. I can only see this appealing to shut-in loners who live their lives playing violent computer games and watching serial killer documentaries 'for fun'.

On this evidence it's time for me to check out from the enduring yet now overbaked Mad Max universe - think i'll rewatch the halcyon days of Mel Gibson's incarnation instead - you'd be well advised to do the same. Ladies and gents - dyin' time is here...",3.0,30 May 2024
"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is an excellent film, dragged down by its over-reliance of CGI, yet the rest compartments is there and Furiosa is spectacular","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is directed and produced by George Miller, who wrote the screenplay with Nico Lathouris. It serves as a prequel and spin-off to Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and focuses on the Fury Road character Imperator Furiosa. Several crew members from Fury Road returned for Furiosa, including composer Tom Holkenborg, costume designer Jenny Beavan, editor Margaret Sixel (Miller's wife), and screenwriter Lathouris. Simon Duggan served as the cinematographer for the film who does as fine a job as John Seale, but his cinematography will never be beaten for this franchise. Duggan's cinematography is great though, a highlight for sure. The film truly feels like a prequel, everything except for the over-reliance of visual effects.

Set 15 to 20 years before the events of Fury Road, in a desert wasteland where warlords fight over the last remaining sources of water, food, weapons, and gasoline, Furiosa traces the young title character's life from her kidnapping by the forces of warlord Dementus to her revenge on the warlord for the loss of her mother. For over a decade, she struggles to survive as a slave and, eventually, a trusted lieutenant of the Citadel's cult leader, Immortan Joe, and his military commander Praetorian Jack.

The film stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne as younger versions of Furiosa (originally portrayed by Charlize Theron), alongside Chris Hemsworth as Dr. Dementus, Tom Burke as Praetorian Jack, Lachy Hulme as Immortan Joe, George Shevtsov as The History Man, John Howard as The People Eater, Angus Sampson as The Organic Mechanic, Nathan Jones as Rictus Erectus, Josh Helman as Scrotus, and Charlee Fraser as Mary Jabassa (the mother to Furiousa). Writing for Empire, John Nugent awarded the film 5 out of 5 stars, and described Taylor-Joy as ""phenomenal"", finding the ""right balance of steeliness and fractured humanity that Theron instilled"". Jada Yuan from The Washington Post thought that Hemsworth had ""created one of the all-time-great screen villains"". These are the main characters of the film, I agree fully with these critics. Chris Hemsworth is a pure joy to watch, truly an energetic and fantastic performance. Without him, I'm sure the film wouldn't have worked as much as it did for me, he sold every single scene. Taylor-Joy is as always, phenomenal, as written.

I think the pacing was not very good, it wasn't bad either, just average. I think it could have been better to make the film flow better, to not feel bloated. 'Fury Road' is two hours but never feels like it, 'Furiosa' feels longer than 148 minutes. I get it how telling the story of Furiosa takes that amount of time, as the scenes we do get is important to her story and character arc. But what they leave out of the film is the war between Immortan Joe and Dr. Dementus. We only see the aftermath of it which is unfortunate because of it being one thing which I really looked forward to, did it end up on the cutting floor? Perhaps, but probably not because of the budget. There's a specific shot which I'm thinking of when Furiousa gets to the battlefield, when Dementus is on the run and she sees the aftermath. Where there's a tracking shot which shows the aftermath. I still would have liked to have seen the battle, but that was brilliantly photographed. Another thing I found a bit lackluster was how we didn't get Charlize Theron back in the role, as at first I bought the whole thing because of it being a prequel but then the film ends as a set up to 'Fury Road' which begins an hour or two after this film. Then again, I think Anya Taylor-Joy did a fine job, incredible even but not as great as Theron. She got to do her own take on the character whilst sticking to Furiousa, her relationship with Tom Burke. The visual effects is also a critique of mine, George Miller over-relied on it but then again I understand why, there's sequences which wouldn't be possible without them, and it becomes safer and easier for him to shoot. The action sequences are still as great and complaining for the film not using as much of practical effects as the previous film, in a world where the film industry is full of over-reliance of CGI. There's something I noticed which bothered me, I don't know if it's only me, but there was something with how some specific scenes were speeded up, the characters movements and so on. Stylistic and intentional? Probably. But if you're curious if the CGI looks as bad as in the trailer? I would say no, it probably does, but you don't notice it as much during the film experience as with the trailer.

Writing for RogerEbert.com, Robert Daniels awarded the film 4 out of 4 stars, and called it ""one of the best prequels ever made"". He praised the storyline, action sequences, and performances. Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood viewed the film as possessing ""the best screenplay of any Mad Max film"". This is so true. I strongly believe this is the best script in any Mad Max film, Fury Road didn't need a great story to work, but this film did. Furiousa: A Mad Max Saga is a great film, if the pacing and the visual effects could have been better, the film would possibly be among the best Mad Max films. I'll rewatch this sometime, that I'm sure of. This year, it's also 9 years since 'Fury Road' was released. George Miller is among these old filmmakers which keeps going and creates truly spectacular films, Furiousa is one of those.",9.0,29 May 2024
The new icon of diesel punk,"I will tell you right away, this is the first film in 2 years that I will definitely review, despite some exaggerations (which I will note later), the picture is exciting and interesting, it simply attracts attention with complex and fascinating cinema language, impeccable camerawork, amazing complex tricks, dynamic chases, monstrous cars, black humor. The work on the film was done at the highest level and required significant efforts on the part of the team of creators - this huge amount of invested effort, which is visible throughout.

Despite his age, George Miller has demonstrated excellent creative form, and over the years he seems to be getting better. This painting is different from anything he has previously created. Being at its core a tragedy of revenge in a post-apocalyptic world, the film contains reflections on a more subtle level of worldview, which are imbued with Miller's life experience and creative trials as a creator.

The director, along with screenwriter Nick Latouris, emphasizes symbolism without flirting with mythology. They honestly show what they realize and understand themselves; carefully, trying not to scare off the viewer, the film asks the audience eager for spectacles: ""What unites an ironic sadistic mission and a cruel dictator? Why do we kill each other and who is leading us to war? For what and for whom are we sacrificing ourselves?""

The spirit of the times, militarism, political populism - are read in the picture, sharp topics are scattered with crumbs that a thoughtful viewer can catch.

We see a crimson crucifixion - a sacrificial cross symbolizing the redemption and salvation of a new earthly cradle, a matriarchal paradise on the remains of the human era. Later, in the finale, the director will finish the story using the same symbolism: the prototype of the temptress will pluck a fruit from a tree grown on a rotten body. Furiosa gives a peach to the chosen sisters - this scene refers to the image of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper"".

The young heroine loses her wig with woven bells - the heroine is freed from childhood illusions, discards the symbol of slavery, and on the strength of this act, on these relics, like a ""phoenix from the ashes"", a renewed Furiosa is reborn. Fueled by revenge, she, gaining strength, goes through time to her destination.

In this world of exuberant colors, Miller presents a new icon of diesel punk - the great, blinded by anger Furiosa.

Being a woman by nature, the author gave her all the power of masculine power and endowed her with prophetic meanings.

Before watching, I understood that the heroine would have supernatural survival skills and fantastic capabilities, and I must admit that this is true: men will crown the path of the avenger with their bones.

But I would like to thank George Miller for the fact that the genocide in his performance looks less humiliating, and at the same time, with a stretch, as close to realism as possible. In his interpretation, Furiosa is a man with a female face: laconic, fearless, with a tense, sullen look, not feeling physical pain, and she transforms mental suffering into testosterone fuel, so she has few replicas in the film, they are dry and functional.

Furiosa symbolically refuses to speak, her psychogenic mutism, caused by a personal tragedy, declares to the outside world about hidden aggression and protest. There is no place for emotions in her heart, there is only searing anger.

To be honest, this fragile creature, with a rough voice, thin hands and a childish face, does not inspire mythological retribution, but ... Taylor-Joy coped with her role perfectly, conveying the image of the avenger as accurately as possible, and her large, childish, expressive eyes captivate with their spontaneity, hypnotize and touch.

All the actors play their roles as well as possible in this high-speed deadly whirlwind of adventures, but there is one character who stands out from all the others - this, of course, is Dementus, a sadistic antihero with a childhood trauma.

This is the best role Chris Hemsworth has played in his entire acting career. Chris Hemsworth really plays in this film, this is the leading role, this is the most striking character: witty, ironic with cruel features. In this story, he is by far the most notable - this is Chris Hemsworth's brilliant benefit. And it seems to me that his image of Dementus clutching a teddy bear to his chest deserves a worthy place on the villainous movie alimp.

I would like to note the excellent work of designers and technical specialists who created impressive combat vehicles and bikes. This is a real work of art, and watching this mechanical power lift clouds of sand at high speed, explode, ram, ferociously twist metal is fascinating.

Stunt work is just an epic mystery, it's a real movie celebration of the profession. The stunts in this movie are unique and inventive and only a stuntman understands how difficult, difficult and dangerous it is. Of course, you can say, ""It's all special effects (VFX)."" But this is not the case. You can't make such a movie without the risky work of stuntmen, and you don't want to look at it through the prism of the ""green screen"", because each scene was created with great attention and love, and this is clearly visible.

What is happening on the screen easily immerses you in events, captivates you with exciting car battles, and evokes emotional empathy.

This is the kind of movie that is so engaging that you don't want the movie to end.

As for the flaws of the painting? Yes, the story is inferior to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", both in content and in the choice of the hero. The plot is very predictable, the turns are not amazing, the director has something to show, but he does not tell as much as he would like, leaving the details out of the frame. The non-mortal Joe is a functional figure who does not participate and does not influence development. The story is based on the realization of revenge, a vivid antagonist and a high-speed adventure.

There are exaggerations in the movie and they, in part, remind of the fantasticism of what is happening, but I forgive Master George Miller everything: I watched Furiosa all 2 hours without stopping, such magic is only possible for a real artist and a professional who is sick of cinematography.",8.0,31 May 2024
A Tale Of Three Furiosas.,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga: A tale of two or rather three Furiosa's; Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't appear until past the half way mark in the film. The young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) lives in the Mothers' Place an oasis amidst the desert. She is kidnapped by raiders as she attempts to sabotage their bikes. Her mother Mary (Charlee Fraser) sets off in pursuit, not just to free Furiosa, but to keep the location of their haven secret. She shoots some of the bikers but one reaches the biker horde camp and is presented to Lord Dementus (Chris Helmsworth) leader of the pack. Mary's rescue attempts fail and Furiosa is brought along by Dementus on his raids, eventually ending up as one Immortal Joe's future brides as a trade. It would be a spoiler to reveal how she got out of this or any of her other adventures. Suffice to say that the Teen Furiosa (an AI process was used to blend the features of Browne and Raylor-Joy) ends up on a war rig with Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), rising through the ranks we finally encounter Taylor-Joy as Furiosa just in time for a war between the desert rulers. Great scenes of the the biker horde, in ways resembling The Golden Horde in their sheer numbers. In a nod to the MCU, Dementius wearing a cloak rides in a chariot pulled by motorbikes whilst one of his sidekicks is dressed like Loki,. Some really gory scenes as captured warriors are made to fight to the death for limited places in the horde. Some of the torture scenes are OTT but more is implied than actually shown. The battle scenes surpass those of Fury Road, with improved aerial action and even more impressive hand to hand fighting and duels on the war rigs. We get underground cannibals and Dementius has a taste for human blood sausage. Great performance from Browne and Taylor-Joy who have few lines and their expressions, gestures and actions are all important. Helmsworth is impressive in a crazy like a fox manner along with George Shevtsov as The History Man who is effectively Dementius' Merlin. A triumphant prequel to Fury Road.

"Enjoyably overblown, empty chase epic.","I saw this at Cineworld, Braintree with my cousins Matthew and Phillip almost nine years to the day when we saw the previous Mad Max film, Fury Road.

Like Fury Road this an enjoyably insane, bonkers and brave piece of filmmaking that never lets up from the start to the finish. Those looking for nuance and subtly need look elsewhere.

The effects, stunts and action are top notch and I respect George Miller in introducing the lead actress, Anya Taylor Joy, nearly an hour into the film-that shows respect the producers have in him and his franchise where a first time filmmaker would have that idea thrown out and the intro would have been 10mins instead.

The plot is hard too follow and Chris Hemsworth is more comical than scary especially when compared to the antagonists in the previous older films-'ToeCutter','Nightrider' and 'The Humungous' where they genuinely were villainous but it's one of them films that, as Matthew said afterwards, you just need to let the film wash over you.",,27 May 2024

I have to say that i really enjoyed this movie i thought it was better than Fury Road which was also good except for Tim Hardys performance which to me was disappointing. Furiosa really reminded me of Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior especially with the big tanker truck scenes and the scavengers all riding up around it trying to take it down .Some really good stunts in this. Chris Hemsworth is really good in this he plays the villian to a tee .To me it was a fun watch especially with the seats we were in that were moving about in coordination with the action sequences in the movie.

There's always hope,"My reading of Mad Max Fury Road has always been an attack on the notion of unskilled labor. In a post-apocalyptic where specialized skillsets are prized above all else, and human beings are reduced to the perceived ""value"" they're able to add to the existing social structure, a group of women with no specialized technical skills or fighting experience prove they are valuable outside their functional utility as ""breeders"" and ""milkers.""

And while many of those elements are still present in this followup prequel to Fury Road, I found myself struggling to grasp the overarching theme for the bulk of Furiosa's runtime, right up until its final moments. Furiosa is a considerably bleaker, more isolating film than Mad Max. Mad Max's egalitarian messaging is lost on Furiosa, an orphaned child forced to independently adapt to rapidly changing social orders in a world she's barely been introduced to, blending in to avoid physical and sexual violence, with none of the support available that she'd grown to rely on in Mad Max. So in lieu of the egalitarian messaging of Mad Max, what we have in its stead is a constantly recurring question: is there hope?

George Miller has been ahead of western culture in matters of environmentalism and climate change for more than 40 years now, an outspoken vegetarian and climate activist. For over 40 years he's remained aware of these issues and watched the rest of us very slowly catch on at a time where it feels like things are too late. It's easy to become despondent and powerless as hardly any meaningful action takes place on an issue you've observed and created art for over a multi-decade career. And with that, we're given Dementus, a character persistently mocking notion of hope, careful to remind everybody he has no hope, treating hope as weakness, a philosophy that spells his downfall, as Furiosa's strength springs from her courage to hope that life can return to this dead world, holding out that there can be a better future so long as there are still people willing to plant trees knowing that they themselves will never get to sit in their shade.

And as it certainly feels like we're on the precipice of our own wasteland, watching the planet slowly die around us, feeling powerless to stop it, I could use more art willing to bring that kind of hope to the bleakest of circumstances.",9.0,24 May 2024

ATJ was the perfect choice to play young Furiosa. Her role was executed perfectly and it made the character Charlize Theron laid the groundwork for in 2015 even more compelling to follow and route for. Anya was menacing, powerful, and was the embodiment of revenge.

Chris Hemsworth stole the show as Dementus. His ability to change characters and divert the audience away from him as an actor is expert level craftsmanship. His voice acting and mannerisms are so specific to this character and every time he was on the screen I was glued to what he was doing and saying.

The carnage in this was on par if not better than that of Fury Road. The design of the war rig for this movie was definitely a step up from the original. The fighting and the action in general were visually stunning.

Furiosa was a near-perfect film that accomplished its goal of further building the world of The Wasteland and giving more details to characters and settings that we have not seen much of in this scarce franchise. I need more films in this universe, even if it takes another nine years between projects like this one and Fury Road. If you enjoyed Fury Road at all then this movie is a must-see. 9/10.",9.0,25 May 2024
Empty canister after Fury Road,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a different movie than beloved Mad Max: Fury Road. Less interesting characters, less engaging story, less spectacular action scenes. How is that possible after epic Fury Road?

I think the movie's story doesn't have fuel to drive me to the edge of my seat like Fury Road did. There were couple moments when I believed it was going to be something emotionally insane but all of them ended flat. The characters are so simple, there is no depth. Furiosa - a kid who was kidnapped, became a badass woman and then waited for the revenge. There is no journey to follow her states of mentality. No preparation, no inner doubts, no weak moments. Just an empty character like a canister. Sadly, the movie isn't building its story to make me excited what's next, what if something goes wrong, it just gives me well-looking cinematography, well-filmed action scenes and just fine dialogues.

On the good side, I am happy Chris Hemsworth got another fun character to play after El Royale. It was pleasure to watch him on the screen. He was charismatic, little crazy, fearless, a man with dark past. The post-apo world turns people into pure madness and he is an example of that.

Another good thing is world-expanding. The movie presents new locations what are strategically important and make the general experience a little bit more attractive.

So if you're expecting a movie with action-packed high stakes, you might get disappointed. If you're expecting JUST a good story and beautiful shots, special effects etc., go watch it.",7.0,24 May 2024

Really good,"#1.... I was never bored, tired, yawning, sleepy, distracted thinking about something else six or etc. I was totally and just moving the whole time which is not an easy thing to do for me. Doesn't mean it's the best movie ever made but it was a good solid movie and it kept my attention the whole time and it was entertaining. I think Chris Hemsworth might have earned himself an Oscar at least a nomination. He was fantastic. I found myself on the edge of my seat trying to hear everything he says. I was enthralled with his character. It's rare I'm interested in seeing a movie again and this one I could an hour later I could definitely watch it again.",10.0,27 May 2024
Not a Fury Road overcomer but Good,"Fury Road is a masterpiece in action films especially for the Mad Max franchise. It took me by surprise so l was eager to watch this pre-quel and it didn't disappoint.

For those unfamiliar, the Mad Max franchise is an Australian dystopian action series created by George Miller and Byron Kennedy. The story centers on Max Rockatansky, a man fighting to stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Australia devastated by societal collapse caused by war and resource depletion.

This film explores Furiosa's origin story detailing her journey as a renegade warrior in a dystopian Australia before she meets and joins forces with Mad Max.

The story takes place around 15 years before Fury Road, where young Furiosa (Anya Taylor Joy) is being taken from her village. Captured by a biker horde under the command of warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), Furiosa finds herself navigating the chaotic ""Waste-land"".

The storyline is developed with characters slightly more fleshed out than the previous film, however; at times, the complexity feels unjustified and becomes noticeably frustrating when character development tries to overshadow the action.

Anya Taylor Joy shines, dominating the screen with her depth and quiet strength. Experiencing Furiosa's transformation throughout the story was a genuine pleasure.

Also the girl, Alyla Browne, who plays young Furiosa did an incredible job, even with minimal dialogue.

Chris Hemsworth tries to steal the show as Dementus, the villainous gang leader, a stark contrast from his usual portrayals as the hero.

In a couple of scenes, by the costumes and hairstyling, he even looks like Thor, yeah Thor, his Marvel counterpart.

Coming to the visuals, the entire place is vividly stunning, captivating your eyes and likely sending your heart rate into pretty much over-drive. The gritty, decayed settings reminiscent of Fury Road pound you with rich rusty hues of orange, red, and yellow, all the while immersing you in a world heavy with metal and gaso-line.

Fury Road set a high standard with its gripping editing, and this movie comes close, complemented by strong sound design.

Cinematography is superb, real delightful. It truly elevates the film in the art of staging, framing action and characters. The action sequences are expertly choreographed keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout.

There are moments of unexpected beauty that leave an impression and yeah this film is IMAX recommended.

As for the VFX, another Fury Road mastery, I expected more as some of the CGI sequences looked a bit fake along with some of the action physics being totally off. However, the fine production design, intense editing and cinematography overcomes this.

George Miller impresses. His ability to build immersive worlds and characters is incompa-rable. The seamless integration of action set pieces into his storytelling leaves you marveling at how he even begins to craft such a film. Certainly, he knows what to do with a valuable franchise and take it forward.

While the action in Furiosa is undoubtedly thrilling, it might not reach the same intensity as Fury Road. However, if you're willing to embrace Miller's dystopian vision fully, you'll still find plenty to enjoy in this cinematic adventure. Worth watching.",7.0,24 May 2024
"No good plot , no much sense , for kids 6-12 years old I think","Oh I don't know where to start .

First she bite the motorcycle hose which is impossible to cut with teeth , then 12-14 years old girl kills everyone , then cars almost flying in the movie , almost superhero movie like Deadpool or spiderman should fly there as well lol .

She cut somehow arm , blocked wheels and they came out when everyone was riding around and like no one seen it and she drove motorcycle with one arm on top of the mountain lol really ? Seriously? Who is this.director of the movie ? A kid who without any knowledge of anything in life .

Check Fallout serious and learn how to make movies .

An Odyssey of Fire and Blood,"Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action films of all time and definitely one of the best films of the last decade. At 79 Years old, Director George Miller aims to give us another action packed romp through the apocalypse through the eyes of Furiosa. I was initially unsure as to why the focus on her, given her complete character arc in Fury Road. But Miller proved me very wrong, this film, despite not quite reaching the insurmountable heights of what came before, blew me away from minute one.

To start with the obvious, the action is superb. Each sequence feels unique, creative and the sound design is top notch. The film doesn't try to imitate Fury Road, instead content to carve out its own identity. This film also does a great job at expanding the Wasteland and the characters within. It does what any good prequel does, expand the scope of the world. Things that were mentions in Fury Road are fully realised here and characters such as Immortan Joe are given enough screen time to flesh them out further.

My main hang up about the film was Furiosa herself. I was ambivalent at Anya Taylor-Joy's casting since I was worried she would exist in the shadow of Charlize Theron. But boy was I wrong. In fact, both actors who play Furiosa do a remarkable job. Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne both do a fantastic job, the transition between the two feels seamless. Anya definitely captures the essence of Theron's performance and masterfully uses her facial expressions to convey the characters thoughts and emotions. She excellently fits into Miller's show don't tell style of filmmaking. Her arc is excellent and will likely enhance her story in Fury Road.

But the absolute standout in this film is definitely Chris Hemsworth as the main antagonist, Dementus. This is a career-best performance by the man and he chews up every scene he is in. He perfectly fits into this magnificent world and acts as an excellent foil to Furiosa. He is amazing.

If there are any issues, it's that there are a few moments in the plot that don't quite add up. There are also and characters ideas that I wish were explored more, but who knows, if Miller makes another one, maybe we'll see them fleshed out too. The only major issue that may take one out is the CGI on occasion. The green screen at times looks really obvious. These moments are few and far between but given the previous films' seamless VFX, this does feel like a step down.

Overall, Furiosa is exactly the film I wanted it to be. It delivers a thrilling revenge story that fleshes out the manic world which the characters inhabit. The action is great, the characters are wonderful and it seamlessly connects with Fury Road while also enhancing that film's payoffs. A perfect prequel, but a great standalone film too. Witness it in theatres if you can.",9.0,26 May 2024
''She is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse...'',"Making a prequel to the best action movie of the last decade involved a big risk.

Establishing as the protagonist of the prequel a character that had been played very well by Charlize Theron, and doing so with another actress, was an even greater risk.

That's director George Miller. A 79-year-old filmmaker who takes risks that younger directors don't dare.

Furiosa goes to the origin of the character. From her childhood in an idyllic place with abundant vegetation, her abduction leads her to know the desolation and scarcity of living in the wilderness, the harsh conditions that will shape her character and her encounter with tyrannical characters. With messianic overtones like Dementus and Immortan Joe.

The film is divided into five chapters: 1) The Pole of Inaccessibility.

2) Lessons from the Páramo.

3) The Stowaway.

4) Back.

5) Beyond Revenge.

Each of the chapters shows the growth in Furiosa's abilities; move at first in a low profile, in silence, without speaking more than necessary.

The vicissitudes of her environment harden her, making anger and the desire for revenge for everything that was taken from her her driving force, to strengthen herself and collect outstanding accounts from Dementus.

Dementus is played impeccably by Chris Hemsworth. We see no trace of Thor in what he does. He's a guy who really knows how to act.

Dementus is a careful opponent for Immortan Joe.

Anya Taylor-Joy builds a contained Furiosa with a remarkable ability to convey emotions with her eyes.

Expressive eyes that connect us with her character and turn the viewer into her ally.

Anyone who expects fast-paced action throughout the film, just like in Fury Road, will find something different here.

Yes, there are incredible action sequences of pure adrenaline.

But also, slow moments in which we see Furiosa adapting to the difficult environment she had to live in.

A counterpoint that provides narrative balance.

As a viewer, it is appreciated that Furiosa is released first in movie theaters before streaming.

Due to its landscapes, production design and visual proposal, it is best enjoyed on the big screen, The Mad Max universe is more alive and furious than ever.",9.0,26 May 2024

"Thoughtful, visually stunning addition to the saga","It's the nice kind of sequel (or prequel) that doesn't try to give more of the same but goes in a (relatively) different direction. Instead of trying to one-up ""Fury Road"" on the action level, ""Furiosa"" dwells on the titular character's background story while, for the first time, giving some worldbuilding info on The Wasteland. There's still some very cool action mind you (the truck chase sequence), which again feels both cutting-edge and old-school - you can see and feel it in your bones that there's only limited CGI here and most of what transpires on screen is real.

But the heart of the film is the sad, tragic story of how Furiosa became who she is. The film takes its sweet own time to get there, and there might be one set piece too many somewhere around there (Bullet Town, anyone?), but it does make sense to spend time on the series of events, fateful encounters and traumas that define her. It's kind of what the first ""Mad Max"" did for Mel Gibson's character, although ""Furiosa"" takes the vengeance trope much more thoughtfully. And this is a post-apocalyptic tale after all, so you do need to address themes of human nature and whether or not man (or woman) will always be a wolf for (wo)man, but here this is done in striking personal terms that make total sense.

Miller is a great director who can tell a story visually, with a handful of beautiful shots that say it all. I will remember for a long time the time-lapsed shot of the tree growing while clinging to Furiosa's hair on it. That's beautiful storytelling if you ask me.",8.0,25 May 2024
Anya Taylor is a joy,"Furiosa Review I was wrong, very wrong I'd written off Furiosa because I wasn't a fan of Fury Road. As even though it's one of the most visually stunning films ever made, it had a wafer thin story and lackluster acting.

However Furiosa is that rare breed of prequel that actually makes the original better - adding world building and really fleshing out the leads backstory.

What you may notice early on, is that there's no bombastic soundtrack, letting the sound of screeching metal do the talking, helping to add to the rawness of the film.

Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't say much but delivers a stoic performance, letting Chris Hemsworth do most of the talking. Somehow he manages to deliver one of his best, if not the best performances of his career wearing a prosthetic nose and false teeth.

Unlike Fury Road there's more noticeable CGI and LED backgrounds instead of the practical carnage these films are synonymous for. This is a minor blip as there are still some incredible practical effects and the car and bike stunts are still great.

Watch it on the big screen (even if you didn't love Fury Road).

"A great follow up, but very different","I feel like this movie is very different in character than Fury Road. It's much larger in scope, and covers so much more, and honestly, I love it for that. It really helps flesh out Fury Road, and makes me want to rewatch it. I'd say to come in with an open mind! Just be aware that this movie is a little more visceral and brutal than the first movie, with a few scenes that make you feel uneasy. Overall, its a different flavor of ice cream from the same director, and the costumes, vehicles, and set pieces are awesome. I bet I'd catch alot more on a rewatch. The movie is decently long, and covers alot of ground! As a final bit, Hemsworth is the perfect villian, and all of the actors of Furiosa were spectacular. They really steal the show. This movie is a refreshing change of pace from the endless superhero movies of today.",9.0,27 May 2024
It was great but certainly not epic,I certainly didn't expect it to be on the same level as fury road and it wasn't. My first issue is the CGI action scenes which really didn't do it for me. But I liked spending more time with the wasteland and seeing more of it. Annya Taylor joy was good for the little time she was in this movie. And it is a good prequel clearing many things of the first movie but the question remains did they really needed to be cleared. But the best part of the movie was Chris Hemsworth. I never imagined him as a villain but he did very well surpassing all expectations. But again the stakes of this film didn't feel large enough and I will be waiting for a madmax movie with the real Max in it.,7.0,24 May 2024
Stands toe to toe with Fury Road,"Fury Road comparisons are inevitable, but I think this movie outdoes it in multiple ways. The acting is better, the cinematography is prettier, the scale is larger, the vibe is more engaging, and the visual effects are wilder and more detailed. The only detractor is added CGI, but to me it was expertly used and it all looked beautiful yet brutal. The only downside for me was pacing, but that is to be expected in any Epic with a large timeframe. The way they handled it with beautiful edits and creative time jumps eliminated any pacing issues for me, though. I recommend the movie, 10/10 must see!!",10.0,24 May 2024
There's no comparison with Mad Max.,"Well if you compare it with Mad Max, you will end up disappointed because there's no comparison. Mad max had better cinematography, better practical effects, better cgi blend and physics, better action sequences, way way better acting and way way way better soundtrack. Edition was flawless, the story was credible and most actions had a repercussion in the story. Last but not least Theron has more character than Taylor-Joy and she was also more believable as Furiosa. The new movie was enjoyable and I realize that it could have been worse, considering what has happened to other Hollywood ""Second parts"", however it could have easily been better, it should!, an that's a shame!. Before watching the movie I realized that might happen considering the actors they chose which are not actually good.",6.0,30 May 2024

We saw 2 1/2 straight hours of action, suspence, plot, acting, music, so much fun, we left thew theater full, happy, amused... It is unfair to rate this under a seven, even 7 is low but I can understand this, in the case that you are not into this kind of movies. The real rate of this is 8.5.

Chris was so great in this role, the accent, the looks, he was a vilain that almost won the audiance, cause his had a cause, a logic in his insanity Even the roles sided this vilain were so cleverly written, amusing, stupid in a way but devoted to the cause of thei leader.

Australia helped a lot with its nature, that will become ours in the near future, if the madness prevail among the leaders of NATO.

I had always in mind that mankind is not so far away from this apocalitic future, while I was driving away , using the highway, I was wondering what if all thosw cars nearby where possble enemies in survival, understanding the spirit of Mad Max, in the way that a peaceful common mind , in that situation will kill you in seconds

"It's no Fury Road, but still a lovely day","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a good movie that has either the fortune or the misfortune of existing as a prequel to a nearly perfect movie. Furiosa can't possibly be as mind-blowing as its predecessor, but it does allow us to spend a little more time in this world and Miller's mind.

While it's absolutely a blast at the cinema, the dizzying heights that Miller drove us back in 2015 aren't quite matched a second time around. But all is not lost: Furiosa is still miles better than the dreck Hollywood usually treats us to over the summer. While any narrative nuance is left in the dust by the film's singular focus on bloody retribution at all costs, it is one hell of a ride. The movie is a unicorn of sorts, a pure and perfect action flick with post-apocalyptic hot rods, gorgeous demolition-derby carnage and demented confidence.

What a visual treat....,"Well i thoroughly enjoyed furiosa , the visuals are amazing, some of the camera work is just simply stunning and the two main characters are great. The set pieces throughout the film will definitely need repeat viewing as theres so much going on. Yes it may be light on plot and story but its just a joy to watch.

The war rig assault in chapter 3 is so creative , never seen such a clever sequence . Critics have said its very simliar to fury road, have to agree but thats no bad thing , to see the furiosa origin story was interesting and the surprise mini engine on her metal arm was genius.!

Hemsworth plays his character well, gets most of the funny lines. Anya barely has any lines when she appears but delivers them well. Her expressions do the heavy lifting in the acting department.

"George Miller appears to be a huge fan of the ScreenX format, this epic is loaded with expanded scenes","100% spoiler free review, where I focus exclusively on the amazing ScreenX experience of George Millers latest Mad Max epic.

I saw Furiosa in a ScreenX theater in The Hague, Netherlands on 23 April 2024. I have been checking ScreenX showings since 2022, with Top Gun: Maverick being my first encounter with the format.

In a ScreenX theater, selected scenes get expanded, to two extra screens on the left and right of the audience, so you get completely immersed into the environment. Where Imax focuses more on a vertical immersion, with a higher screen, ScreenX is somewhat like a modern, movie-focused version of the Omnimax format. All 8 or so ScreenX movies that I have seen so far had original footage from the filmmakers. You really get to see more of the movie than what you can see in other theater formats. There is no equivalent for home video yet, although I can imagine that there could be VR releases at some point.

My most recent.show before this movie was Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which I enjoyed a lot in ScreenX, read my other review. But Furiosa beats anything I have seen so far! George Miller has embraced the format and although I have not timed it, has shot almost more scenes in the expanded format than parts without it. It is such a trip! There were audience members for whom this was their first ScreenX experience and they were notably impressed.

If you have access to a ScreenX theater in a 3 hour driving radius, seriously consider that journey. It is really worth it to see Furiosa in ScreenX!",9.0,24 May 2024
A stunning visual feast that can't reach the heights of what's come before,"Arriving almost a decade after the box office smashing, Oscar winning and critical and audience darling Fury Road roared into cinemas, there's no doubt that the odds stacked against the success of George Miller's latest bout of post-apocalyptic chaos were fairly significant but in good news for all, Miller's Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is another highly entertaining blockbuster ride, even though in many aspects it lives in its predecessors shadow.

Clocking in at an epic 148 minutes running time, Furiosa is the longest Mad Max feature yet and when compared directly with Fury Road's tight and taut thrill ride offering, there's clear instances where one feels as though this relatively simple yet drawn out prequel tale of how wasteland warrior Furiosa became who she was (here played in equal parts by Alyla Brown and then Anya Taylor-Joy) could have been sharpened in the editing suite.

Broken up into five separate chapters, Miller gets stuck straight into things as a child Furiosa is kidnapped by members of Chris Hemsworth's Dr. Dementus's bloodthirsty clan and then subsequently introduced to the dangerous world at large that includes Immorten Joe and his Warboy tribe and while here there are all the typical car, truck and bike sequences that fans have come to expect and love from the Mad Max world, this time around Miller takes his foot off the pedal more than you'd expect to offer insight into the wider landscape and the characters within it to varying results of interest.

Judged purely on an eye-candy and set-piece factor, Furiosa is clearly ahead of most of the pack, even if this time around thanks again to Fury Road, much of what we see here doesn't have the same surprise or wow factor as what has come before and while you can't deny the craftsmanship and planning that has taken place to make everything happen here, when compared with new and older entries there's more of a CGI vibe and manufactured feeling than the prior Miller efforts that we can probably say now with a fair amount of assurance peaked with Fury Road and Road Warrior.

Spoiling us in the past with action affairs that pushed the limits of what we thought was possible for the cinematic medium, even now at the age of 79 years Miller's latest film is filled with some world-class moments and some fun acting turns, this time courtesy of a prosthetic-clad Hemsworth having a blast being the big bad and a mostly scrawling Taylor-Joy, who against all the odds manages to say even less than Tom Hardy did back in 2015.

There's potential here that if we were witness(me)ing Furiosa outside of having partaken in Fury Road we may look at it with a different lens and judged it differently and while in its own right we have an entertaining Summer blockbuster on our hands here, you can't help shake the feeling there's not a lot that occurs in Furiosa that is going to stick in the memory, no character moments or action set pieces that will live on long after the dust has settled, making this latest venture in Miller's demented version of the end of the world a fun but far from essential one.

Final Say -

Unlikely to create the lightning in a bottle magic of Fury Road's outstanding successes or the unexpected sights found with the 1979 original and its ground-breaking sequel, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is an above average Hollywood event film that fails to ever overcome the hardships of reaching the heights of what has paved the way for its existence.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga Was An Ok Addition To The Mad Max Franchise,"It's a great film to watch, i love seeing the big scale of it in the theaters, and i guess that's the best thing in Furiosa for me, disappointing? No, could've been way better? Yes, i think Furiosa is still a pretty intriguing movie to watch from the beginning till the end overall, it just that the film already giving you the clue that it's not gonna be Fury Road in the pretty weak opening scene, not bad but for a Mad Max film it should've been more explosive, some of the transition editing i just wasn't a big fan of it, and if you want my comparison to Fury Road from a guy who didn't like Fury Road, i think Furiosa could've been a really great movie if it have the action like Fury Road and actually have a great interesting story and characters development, they have it and it's not bad but wasn't as great as i wanted in terms of the action and the story, performances wise i think was the strongest aspects of Furiosa, Hemsworth is easily giving one of his best performance, and Anya Taylor-Joy was also great, the action was again good but i wish it was a Fury Road greatness of action, they thankfully added a more big story to it and it was an ok story i must say, but still wasn't the best, and i do wish that it was better, i do like the narration style of it makes it felt more epic scale, and overall Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga was an ok addition to the Mad Max franchise, it takes some things that half not as good as the previous film in terms of the action, but filled the missing important stuff from the previous movie didn't have which is an actual story and they have it although wasn't as great as it should be it still an ok story that i can still follow throughout the film, and great performances by all the cast.",7.0,24 May 2024
Bombastic action!!,"Went to this one cautiously optimistic. It exceeded my expectations in every way. This is how action is done, with a great backstory to back it all up. It's not constant action like Fury Road. This one takes some time to build Furiosas backstory and set up the backdrop for the climax of the film. Action sequences are gripping and intense, cinematography is breathtaking at times.

Furiosa felt like a desperate call back to Fury Road,"I should've saved my money and just watched Dune II for a 5th time tonight

First things first:

Chris Hemsworth character and acting was so amazing to the point where it kind of highlighted everyone else's mid level acting and made for clunky back and forth interactions where no other character could match his performance. By the end of the movie I felt like the actors weren't even sure who they were supposed to be.

The whole movie seemed like this desperate tugging at my sleeve saying ""remember how bad ass Fury Road was?? Remember that thing you saw in Fury Road?? Well here's another thing kind of like that thing that we'll go ahead and over-explain to you...""

It all felt like one big insecure call back to Fury Road. There were so many plot holes it just became condescending.

The movie has these 3 or 4 incredible scenes and each one fizzles out and is followed by 20 minutes of awkward dialogue and unexplained plot holes.

In conclusion:

Mad Max Fury Road was this visual rock opera masterpiece that you were just thrust into and it didn't spoon feed you backstory or corny exposition. It was original, it was thought out and it was a perfectly bifurcated story of redemption and vengeance with rich characters and world building.

Furiosa was a good movie....unless you've seen Fury Road, then you recognize that it's just a sloppy double dipping of its masterpiece predecessor.

A poor imitation that nobody asked for....,"People questioning why this movie failed to perform to expectations at the Box Offic really need to take a step back.

This movie is way overhyped and fails to come even close to Fury Road almost 10 years ago.

With the exception of ATJ and Chris Hemsworth who I thought were both great the movie suffers from being overly long (could have shaved 45 mins off) and bogged down by a messy anti-climactic story.

Unlike Fury Road this movie never achieves lift off.

Every time you think ok the movie is building to a boil it goes back to a simmer. Very frustrating. The movie also relies too much on bad Green Screen/CGI compared to Fury Road. It's noticeable which you didn't really notice in FRoad.

The best action movie of the Year!,"I would like to start by saying that I've been waiting for the film since the announcement, and it's been a couple of years. What can I do? Expectations were overestimated by themselves. After all, Fury Road was and remains a great movie.

And now the long-awaited sequel, it's a prequel, has come out and what have we got?

There were various rumors. Allegedly, the studio insisted on some additional filming and stretching the timing. It didn't do the movie any good. It seems to me that the first 2 chapters could have been shortened and it only benefited the film.

Starting from chapter 3, the long-awaited action begins, but it seems that the music is familiar and the scenery and cars are driving and even there are explosions! But it's not like that. It is clear that the film does not have enough budget. There are not enough elements in the frame. Yes, there are scenes where a bunch of cars and bikes are driving through the desert, but then there is no action in the frame.

There is a moment, literally the last half hour of the film, when the climax is about to be, a hurricane of death and metal, but it all turns into a slide show, and after that there are the following scenes leading up to the finale. Then these wonderful dialogues and the finale.

The finale, provided that the viewer, like a small child, was taken away sweets in the form of spectacular action scenes and slipped almost 1.5 hours of dialogues, the finale with a tree is really strong. It's a good scene.

In general, all sins can be forgiven for the film. And the graphics and the excess of dialogues where it is not necessary and the silence where it would be possible to say something if this film had been released before Fury Road. After all, the ending asks you to turn on the last part and start watching.

As the beginning of some grandiose story, this is very good, but as a film that he has been waiting for for so long, unfortunately does not meet all expectations.

It's a really good movie. 2+ hours fly by in one breath, not counting some scenes, but there are a minority of them.

Be sure to watch it in a movie. The authors should be supported. Still, I want to see another movie in this frightening and attractive universe. The main thing is for the director to live up to this!",8.0,24 May 2024

Very well Done Movie.,"This is an amazingly done and thought out movie - one can see by just looking at the artistry done by the VFX and team and the whole editing department, who ever was pet of the location scouting crew on this movie...blew...my...mind.

Now to me, personally Frank Miller is not on my top five or even top ten directors list, but if this director can keep making movies with this thought out cinematography than maybe their will be a spot on one of those two lists. I have seen only one other Mad Max movie and that was the previous one that came out in 2015 with Tom Hardy as the lead and Charlize T as the vengeful Furiosa and that movie was a whole wasteland filled epic flick.

Not lying here but I did not expect how long they were going to spend on Furiosas background, and thought it was incredibly paced out with the random quips from Chris Hemsworths character to the random funny extra side characters flying off of the bikes it was a boost to be herd.

My complaint was of the certain scene changes I think could of been handled a tad bit better! But hey do not listen to me. I am no film director or actor I am just and IMBD'er reviewer. The score was done great which helped add the suspense of the scenes. And that tree scene (if you know/you know.)

Overall a great movie well worth the 9(10) year wait. That's what I love about certain directors- they do not plummet release after release on you. That shows a care for one's project and a necessity that we need to see more of in Hollywood. I CAN NOT STRESS ENOUGH GO SEE IT!!!",8.0,24 May 2024
Exactly what a prequel should be!,"It's the perfect prequel to Fury Road. Immediately after seeing it, we went home to rewatch Fury Road. They fit together so nicely. Just like Rogue One into A New Hope-well maybe not that seamlessly. But regardless, they are an awesome pair. Alyla Browne is an excellent Furiosa. Not sure why they don't show her much in the trailers and media and such. Sure Anya-Taylor Joy is great too but she plays Furiosa for a lot less time than Browne does. And Chris Hemsworth as Dementus is incredible. Really demented and crazy. Love that triple bike he rides like a chariot haha. I understand not everyone will like the film, but that 90% on Rotten Tomatoes for both the critic and audience score seems accurate to me. It's an awesome film.

An Overly Bloated Yet Solid Prequel That Deserves To Be Witnessed,"With all of the unnecessary sequels and prequels on the market in this day and age I think Furiosa is one that stands out as a middle of the road kind of film whereas I think that there were a fairly decent amount of people wondering about her backstory while the other half who saw Mad Max Fury Road were probably a give or take on the ask for a prequel story to the main character in Fury Road. And yes I say main character because Tom Hardy as Mad Max in Fury Road felt more like a supporting character in a film with his character's name in the title. Which I guess can be perceived as neither a good nor bad thing when the movie kicks as much butt as Fury Road did. Furiosa on the other hand kicked some butt and took some names but in no way near the amount of volume and pinpoint precise pacing as Fury Road did. While Furiosa was engaging at times and had great acting and a blend of practical and special effects as seen in Fury Road, it's 2 hour and 28 minute runtime felt overly bloated causing folks like myself to get a bit restless watching the numbered chapters (yes there's numbered chapters like a book) unfold. The pacing tries to keep you stringing along but cannot hold a candle to the razor focused pacing present in Fury Road. Other than that, the plot kind of goes where you kind of suspect it does in the end as you watch how Furiosa goes from cautious child warrior to early adult warrior and they show how she loses her hand and such by the end of the film that brings back many callbacks from Fury Road including a lot of the key players from that movie minus Max of course. Although we don't need sir grunts a lot Tom Hardy when we have Tom Burke portraying Praetorian Jack, who looks and feels like Mel Gibson's Mad Max character in all but name who acts as a kind of mentor and friend to Furiosa for the good part of the second act of the film. I wish we got to see more of him as he held his own and did and said more in 1 act than Tom Hardy's Max did in the entirety of Fury Road. The other saving grace of this film was Chris Hemsworth as Dementus who really showed up for work in this one delivering a wacky performance and felt right at home in a movie about being a ruler in a daft post apocalyptic wasteland. Anya Taylor Joy was also very good portrayal of Charlize Theron's Furiosa of course as she typically gives her all in everything she does and she pulls no punches here either as the lead. Overall, while I enjoyed Fury Road as a whole more, Furiosa probably has better characters that feel a bit more fleshed out at least while retaining the feel of being a bit crazed within a mad gone world.",7.0,29 May 2024
A solid addition to the Mad Max franchise,"Writer/director/producer George Miller has created what has to go down as one of the best series of films ever made. Miller has made five Mad Max films and all of them are very good. Not a dud in the bunch. It's quite an amazing feat. ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" fits right in with the rest of them. It's a great looking movie that has imagination to share. It's filled with solid performances but none are better than Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth is given a great character and some terrific dialogue and he hits the ball out of the park. I enjoyed ""Furiosa"" today (AMC Raceway 10, Westbury, NY) but I actually think I'll like it even more the next time around.",8.0,1 June 2024
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"The young ""Furiosa"" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing ""Dementus"" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her ""Little D""! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The ""Immortan Joe"" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the ""Guardian of Gastown"" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the ""Bullet Farm"" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement ""Dementus"" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with ""Joe"" but only if he trades his ""Little D"" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver ""Praeteorian Jack"" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of ""Smeg"", ""Rictus Erectus"" and ""Scrotus"" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2½ hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",7.0,28 May 2024
It's No Fury Road...,"But I love it in a way for it being itself. Mad Max: Fury Road was the first Mad Max movie I've seen and is to this day my favorite action movie of all time. In fact, I hold Fury Road dear because of my father. I would've loved to have seen this movie with him, but sadly he's no longer here. It was because of him I got into the Wasteland. If he were here, he would've enjoyed this movie.

I love this movie, but not as much as I love Fury Road. Really, I would be giving this a 7.5, but we do that here so according to IMDb, it's an 8. I could give this movie a 7, but I enjoyed it more than the people I saw this movie with. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me.

As for the movie itself, it felt like it was just a movie with two factions in a battle for the citadel and control over the Wasteland, with Furiosa caught in the middle of it. She went from one faction to another, and as we all know, stayed with Immortan Joe until she wanted freedom for herself and the other women she befriended while she was there. It didn't really feel like Furiosa was the focus for the first half of the movie.

The action sequences were great, but compared to Fury Road's, they didn't all bring me to the edge of my seat, but that's not to say that there are some that didn't. One in particular was the sequence with The War Rig when Furiosa and Jack were attacked. That was well shot.

As for the CGI, I miss it when movies didn't make the CGI so obvious and made it look more realistic. You can tell from the backgrounds easily, especially at the nighttime.

Otherwise, the characters were all well done.",8.0,26 May 2024
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga delivers an action-packed post-apocalyptic cinematic experience,,8.0,24 May 2024
"A thrilling and worthy prequel to the modern classic ""Fury Road""...","An afternoon out at a chilly mall on a typical blazing hot day in Bangkok led to some shopping at Adidas and this newly-released movie at the cinema. The latest entry in the Mad Max saga from the twisted and colorful mind of George Miller is a worthy prequel to the modern classic ""Fury Road"". Anya Taylor-Joy acquits herself well and ably steps into the role made iconic by Charlize Theron, filling in her back story to good effect, but a real standout is Chris Hemsworth as Dementus, excellent from beginning to end with a particularly satisfying final scene.

The film is a steampunk road-rage apocalyptic fantasy with customarily excellent set design and decoration, with fascinating vehicle contraptions tearing over the Australian desert wasteland. The score is propulsive and cinematography breathtaking, and while I don't know that it's as good as ""Fury Road"", it's definitely one worth seeing in the theatre. And FTR, it's heaps better as a prequel than ""Solo"" was in the Star Wars universe.",8.0,24 May 2024
What a prequel,"I don't think another prequel has ever been as good as this.

The movie starts off quite slow, building the entire narrative and characters. Possibly a bit too long here, but maybe that's because we've had so many movies lately that just don't bother with this. The mid part of the film is when things start to pick up.

What blew me away though, was how well this integrates with Fury Road. It is so well done in almost every way.

I saw this on iMAX. I will say, some of the CGI is a little off when you are viewing this close on a massive screen - ie trucks / bikes going up hill and some of the jumps. Not sure I noticed this in the first one.

I'm still undecided on which movie is the better one. I think Fury Road, as it's a bit more action packed from beginning to end, but this movie is very fitting and well done for what it is.

I will say that Anya did an awesome job.

Hopefully we get more.",9.0,24 May 2024
Not quite a lovely day but still plenty to witness,"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)

Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the best cinematic experiences of my life because of how exhilaratingly crazy it felt in terms of action, visuals, sound, dialogue and characters. Naturally, comparisons were inevitable. After Fury Road, I was filled with so much adrenaline that I spent the next hour in a joyous frenzy as I sliced the road in my humble vehicle. This time, the madness itself just wasn't there to the same degree especially when I compare it to how I drive every day in the Fury Roads of Saudi Arabia.

The story is well built where we get Furiosa's full journey since childhood as well as the characters who have impacted her life. It uses a chapter structure which made it feel like a collection of segments instead one wild ride. It's like instead of passionately assembling a brand new car, they used spare parts with a new coat of paint. Looks great, sounds familiar but doesn't create the same driving experience.

While Anya Taylor Joy knows how to act and make appropriate faces, her elegant figure just isn't suitable for such kind of a role. When she does impressive acrobatics and feats of agility, it looks fantastic, but when she swings heavy objects and yanks people twice her weight with one fragile arm, it creates a huge disconnect. Moreover, Furiosa goes through an unimaginable journey and yet, she never expresses a single emotion whether it's pain, despair, fear or joy, making it impossible to emotionally care for her actions, revenge or wellbeing. It's hard not to compare her to Charlize Theron who felt imposing while creating that emotional connection.

The sound, colors and decorations were fantastic and they make the cinematic experience worth it even though it's levels behind Fury Road. Music was unfortunately lacking. The film makes the Wasteland extremely unforgiving, showing that no matter who you are, you will have a hard time surviving. I came in expecting it to be below the original so I wasn't disappointed; however, I wish it had a bit more of the raw energy to make the experience more spectacular.

I'm Furiosa!,"George Miller continued with the legacy of his work, Furiosa is a frenzy of pure cinema in high quality, he does not skimp on his production and that gives us a work that is capable of establishing a good chemistry between the viewer and the protagonist of the film.

The most notable thing is that it is capable of exceeding its limits on the road, where Miller's imagination has no limits and he brings out his best cards with a very good cast, the powerful Anya Taylor Joy is versatile in whatever she proposes, we He gave a legendary cameo in Dune and with this film he continues to immortalize his name into a new golden era for his generation.

Perhaps the only drawback that I see in this film is its narrative consistency, at all times it knows how to keep the common viewer, but apparently the secondary characters do not know how to be so charismatic in their own story.",9.0,23 May 2024
"Downgrade from Fury Road. Poor story and pace, but amazing worldbuilding","I thought that it was such a strange movie, it had arthouse elements and a very jagged pace & story.

They had some really good ideas, but the movie felt just cobbled together from pieces.

If ""fury road"" was put together like one big slab of perfection, this was a collection of some good and some bad ideas, and not all stuck.

The cinematography was of all over the place.

It had some really brutal moments too, and then it would jump to almost a fairy tale style. Brilliant world building, but it felt weighed down by its lore here.

The ending is good and Chris Hemsworth is really really good, but it's a step down from Fury Road.",7.0,31 May 2024
"Do you know any other ""old"" directors who still know what an action spectacle on the big screen looks like?","George Miller is back at doing what he does best. Furiosa is another fine piece of vehicular action picture that carries enough momentum to keep you on edge and just a little bit more drama than Fury Road to show the backstory of a badass character. Anya Taylor Joy felt right as Furiosa, and at one moment her tone felt very similar to Charlize Theron's, and so did the little girl playing her even younger version. Not only that, we have Chris Hemsworth at his most antagonistic role which is a memorable addition to the franchise. Some of the characters known well from the previous movie return here, some new ones appear like the deuteragonist Pretorian Jack and Scabrous Scrotus. This time the story is more focused on the relationship of Furiosa and Dementus, and without spoiling anything, the similar kind of animosity between Furiosa and Immortan Joe isn't explored here as much as it was made to believe in Fury Road. However, it still sets up Fury Road nicely. All technical aspects seem and sound good too although maybe vfx look a little too cgi-ish.

My issue with this one, as I write this review after watching this movie freshly and so early is that it made me left wanting for more despite being the longest movie in the series. I don't remember having such problem with Fury Road, and comparatively this movie feels less intense. Maybe another viewing isn't so unlikely, maybe it'll feel more conclusive and satisfactory then. It is still a good enough one to have seen in the theatre.",8.0,23 May 2024
Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.8 Overall, a visually stunning and entertaining action epic that blends visual effects with expert execution to paint technically impressive action sequences set across the backdrop of a mad wasteland, but this movie feels more like fan service to Mad Max: Fury Road than a stand-alone movie as Furiosa feels like a cameo in her own movie.

Direction: Good The direction on a macroscale picks off where 'Fury Road' left off as it continues to convey beautifully stunning action-sequences and paint a grand wasteland, and it feels even more realistic this time around; the direction on a microscale showcases the capability of these actors, but these interpersonal sequences are so scarce that it feels like they wasted the actor's talents; the storytelling is pretty good as the movie is structured into chapters, but it feels like some of these characters are too simple and bloated; builds tension well in the action sequences (especially how long they are because it leads to many twists and turns)

Story: Decent The concept is unintentionally interesting because this movie feels more like exposition for 'Fury Road' rather than 'Furiosa' (and this is actually good in some perspective because 'Fury Road' is void of this); the plot structure is very bloated because the movie has five chapters that feel longer than they need to be (especially considering there is barely any dialogue); the character writing is not that great because it does not provide any depth to Furiosa that is not already given in Fury Road, but the writing for Dementus is pretty good; the forced relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is not written that well; the story honestly feels like it is fan service for 'Fury Road' rather than being a stand-alone movie

Screenplay: Decent The dialogue is intentionally void of dialogue to make the movie more focused on its action sequences, but this creates a problem when all the good lines are used up in the trailer; the humor is more childish and playground this time around (but it's still somewhat funny); the symbolism is somewhat prevalent as it deals with growth, life, and redemption; the foreshadowing is solely based on this movie being a prequel and that you already know what is going to happen

Acting: Decent to Pretty Good Anya Taylor-Joy: Decent to Pretty Good (Showcases the anger and rage of Furiosa as she tries to find her way home, but her talents are wasted because she feels like a cameo in her own movie ) Chris Hemsworth: Good (His over-the-top villain nature helps paint this character and create an egotistical dynamic that steals scenes from other actors; has great chemistry with Taylor-Joy) Tom Burke: Decent (Really isn't given any material to work with) Alyla Browne: Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the young Furiosa well) Rest of the cast: Decent (No memorable performances because everyone just feels like pawns in the overarching action sequences)

Score: Good to Very Good Really feels grand and helps paint the scenes and action-sequences (but honestly feels like if we had 'Dune' at home)

Cinematography: Great Helps paint this world and its action-sequences

Editing: Good Feels very polished and well executed

Sound: Incredible Helps paint the action sequences and the motorcycle engines

Visual Effects: Incredible Uses CGI and practical effects very well to create epic action-sequences

Production Design: Incredible Uses CGI and on-set locations to make this world feel like a wasteland

Makeup: Very Good Helps paint the inhabitants of this mad wasteland

Costumes: Great Helps paint the inhabitants of this mad wasteland

Pacing Pacing is pretty slow because of multiple factors (it is a lot longer than it needs to be, the action sequences are very long, and the movie is void of dialogue); this movie would have benefited from 20-30 minutes cut and added to 'Fury Road'

Climax Climax is executed very well and helps tie this movie into 'Fury Road'

Tone Tone is very similar to 'Fury Road'

Final Notes Almost all of the best scenes and shots were used in the trailer; this movie just feels like George Miller said 'Hey guys, remember how I made Mad Max: Fury Road, well here's Fury Road Part 0.",7.0,24 May 2024

Furiosa is a thrilling ride in the wasteland,"#Furiosa (⭐⭐⭐⭐) is a relentless, adrenaline-pumping actioner from #GeorgeMiller, set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The film's action sequences are brutal, exciting, and innovative, featuring engaging set pieces and characters. Despite a somewhat thin premise, the action remains a standout. #ChrisHemsworth delivers a compelling performance, his intimidating presence suggesting potential for a spin-off origin film for his character. #AnyaTaylorJoy is commendable, bringing sufficient depth to her role. However, the subplot exploring Furiosa's origins feels weak and underdeveloped. Overall, Furiosa serves as a worthy prequel with unparalleled action choreography, although the climax may feel off and stretched, potentially disappointing fans expecting a stronger ending.

Watch or Not?

Excellent addition,"The cinema was strangely empty on opening weekend, but I am so glad I got to enjoy this excellent addition to the series on the big screen!

Amazing plot, acting and action! 10/10

There where moments which to me seemed too skipped over and not explained well enough.. like, fairly sizeable leaps at times, leaving you to draw the line between the dots. Understandable choice given the short attention spans of today, it wouldn't have hurt though.. -1

Audio was lacking clarity, the muddiness of bass overlapped tenfold in many scenes and high level distortion through the mids and highs detracted from its due sense of quality. I watched this in a v-max cinema, meant to be the pinnacle of audio/visual, but kinda lacked in audio which could've been the cinema or the production. 5/10 stars for audio -1

Go see it on the big screen while you can!!!! :D,"I thought it was brilliantly entertaining, and did not notice the 2.5 hour's go by at all. Similar riffs to the other movies Miller has done. But it just feels even more in your face. And as others have said, the cinematography, stunts, colourisation, players etc. Are pretty damn amazing.

My fave has always been the Road Warrior since I saw it when it came out at a very loud cinema back in the day. For me, Furiosa just pips Fury Road. I loved all the players, especially young Furiosa, and of course Anya as young adult Furiosa (with her ""eye-acting"" as I heard her call it in an interview!) And most definitely Chris Hemsworth as Dr. Dementus. He's got great comedy-chops!

Finally, whether you like the series that much or not, this is quite delicious on the big screen (which movies like this were made for) - it's fun, demented, gruesome, scary, exhilarating, wild, and awesome.

The Fast and the Furiosa.,"Whilst I don't have much history with the other ""Mad Max"" films I did see ""Fury Road"" and, like everyone, thought it was amazing. ""Furiosa"" whilst not quite as dynamic or immediate as the film it's prequel-ling, is still great.

Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is kidnapped by a Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) torturing and killing her mother to get them to give up the location of their settlement. Years later, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) is now working on the War Rig, shifting supplies between Immortan Joe's (Lachy Hulme) Citadel, the Bullet Farm and Gastown, which is now under the control of Dementus. Dementus though has plans to rule all the wasteland, which may give Furiosa her chance for revenge.

Whereas ""Fury Road"" was a nonstop chase movie, this is much more of a world building action drama. The relationships are established, and we take the time to see Dementus take control of Gastown, rather than just learning that it has happened. Furiosa begins as a young child, traded for her lack of mutations then escaping and growing up pretending to be a male in the Citadel. Taylor-Joy has barely any lines of dialogue and it's mostly her expressive eyes that do an able job of conveying her emotions. Fortunately, she's supported by a staggering performance from Chris Hemsworth. Whilst the fake nose might be questionable, the verbosity of a man driven to psychoses by grief, the duality of his ambition mixed with incompetence, and the threat of Dementus are reason enough to see the film.

Thought they're fewer and further in between than in ""Fury Road"" the action scenes in ""Furiosa"" are similarly spectacular. The best of which is probably the attack on the War Rig by The Octoboss, one of Dementus' lieutenants who becomes disillusioned and goes rogue.

Whilst not quite as visceral as its predecessor, nobody makes these film quite like George Miller, I really should try and see the earlier set.",8.0,28 May 2024
Taylor-Joy deserves more credit for carrying this saga,"If we've learned anything from the 'Mad Max' franchise, it's that George Miller's wild, wacky post-apocalyptic Australia is one messed up place. In 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,' we get a better glimpse into the story of the vengeful femme fatale who stole the show in 2014's 'Mad Max: Fury Road.'

Of course, the main difference here is that it's Anya Taylor-Joy who makes the ""shaved-head look"" interesting instead of Charlize Theron, and while some may say this casting swap doomed this film's chances at the box office, it's not fair to pin this squarely on Taylor-Joy. She does an admirable (and more importantly, believable) job portraying the titular character and is evenly matched with the primary villain, Chris Hemsworth's deranged rebel leader, Dementus.

But as with most 'Max' films, it's not all about the acting. Instead, it's the jaw-dropping landscapes and sets, spine-tingling action sequences and over-the-top makeup jobs that bring 'Furiosa' to life. Equal parts thrill ride and horror show, Miller knows how to leave a lasting impact on his audience.

Sure, it could have been a bit of a shorter ride, and yeah, it would have been better had they found a way to work Tom Hardy's character in somehow (even if it was in a parallel timeline). But as a standalone movie, 'Furiosa' is well worth the price of admission.",7.0,1 June 2024
Full of sound and fury and signifying nothing,"To say this was disappointing would be an understatement. After the brilliance of Fury Road I was eager to see what a Furiosa standalone film might offer. I was initially disappointed to hear that Charlize Thero would not be reprising her role but it was going to be a prequel. I went in with an open mind, but felt something that I never felt in any of the other Mad Max films: boredom. None of the previous films have a strong story and it's mostly about the characters and the world they currently inhabit, the struggle to survive or rebuild a stable society. But Furiosa is just a series of action scenes that don't amount to much. Anna-Taylor Joy is not given much to build on the character and it is a lot of references to Fury Road. Chris Hemsworth is without a doubt the most dull villain of the entire series and comes across as a post apocalyptic Jack Sparrow rather than a real character. The CGI effects were terrible. I saw this in an Imax theater and the sound was deafening. I had to plug my ears on several occasions. It didn't enhance the experience with the sound turned up so loudly, which also made dialogue impossible to hear. When all is said and done I just had no interest in the characters. In Fury Road there was a clear objective and we sympathize with them, but in Firiosa I had no clue what was going on at any given moment. It ultimately just devolved into a revenge plot with the dumbest outcome. Don't believe the hype. It's not really that good. Hopefully this will be the last of the Mad Max franchise. It's a shame; it had potential to be great and possibly top its predecessor. I think it will fade away from public attention and not be as highly regarded as Fury Road.",5.0,25 May 2024
"Masterful storytelling, a showcase of George Miller's incredible direction.","Film Review: Furiosa

Plot and Writing ""Furiosa, A Mad Max Saga"" is a near-perfect addition to the Mad Max franchise, weaving a tale of vengeance and survival that seamlessly connects to the beginning of ""Fury Road."" Spanning many years, the film traces Furiosa's transformation from a displaced orphan to a formidable road warrior. Despite the extensive timeline, the narrative keeps audiences engaged by providing just enough from each arc to develop the story and characters effectively. The immersive settings of Bullet Farm, The Citadel, and Gastown are meticulously crafted, creating a vivid and lived-in dystopian world where power is everything. The narrative flawlessly depicts this harsh reality.

Rating: 9/10

Performances and Characters Chris Hemsworth/Dementus: Hemsworth excels as the sadistic villain Dementus, bringing depth to the character's tormented background. He immerses himself in the Wasteland setting, depicting Dementus's journey through hopelessness and depravity as he struggles to control his gang of degenerates.

Anya Taylor-Joy/Furiosa: Taylor-Joy delivers a compelling performance, capturing Furiosa's hard, driven, and vengeful nature. Her use of silence and expressive acting conveys the character's depth, seamlessly transitioning into the legacy established in ""Fury Road.""

Ensemble Cast: The use of Australian actors adds authenticity, with familiar accents enhancing the Wasteland feel. The returning faces and a surprise inferred cameo from Mad Max himself contribute to continuity, with strong performances all around.

Rating: 9/10

Pacing The film is divided into acts that artfully span years, allowing audiences to witness the development of Furiosa and Dementus. This structure provides insight into the characters' trials and turmoils without delving too deeply, making viewers feel connected to the story's hero, villain, and setting in a remarkably short time.

Rating: 9/10

Direction/Cinematography George Miller's classic cinematography and direction connect this installment well with its predecessors. The chase scenes are epically choreographed, and the scaling shots of the Wasteland fortresses convey gravity and omnipresence. Miller's use of delirium techniques and close-ups draws audiences into the characters' experiences. Low-mounted cameras highlight the thrill of the road, while long shots of the desert paired with heat mirages enhance the feeling of isolation.

Rating: 10/10

Sound The soundtrack creates urgency with high-tempo music during chase scenes and uses silence effectively to emphasize moments of peace or dialogue. Traditional Australian instruments, like the didgeridoo, underscore many tracks, adding to the immersive atmosphere. Mechanical sounds from locations like Gastown, coupled with the roar of engines and explosive effects, highlight the intimidating presence of Dementus's gang and contribute to the overall immersive experience.

Rating: 9/10

Overall ""Furiosa"" is a masterful piece of storytelling, showcasing George Miller's incredible direction and providing an immersive cinematic experience. It stands as a testament to the enduring appeal and depth of the Mad Max franchise.

One of if not the greatest Prequels Ever!,"Mad Max movies are told as legends so they don't have to perfectly overlap or be picked apart like you would with a typical Prequel. Once you realize that, this is Pure Taylor Joy from start to finish. Pun intended.

George Miller is a master of R Rated Action films that convey the brutality of war without the need of excessive gore or scenes that would give some nightmares. There are plenty of epic deaths, but individually nearly all of them could be a single death in a PG-13 movie.

George outshines so many directors with these last 2 films and furthers separates himself from a director like Michael Bay when it comes to greatness and beautiful action sequences.

Going into this I knew that Fury Road was almost entirely storyboard and didn't have the script that movies typically require to obtain a good cast and budget. However, the story and script were written for Furiosa prior to the filming of Fury Road and most of the team involved were privy to it. I don't remember who it was in Blood, Sweat, and Chrome that said Furiosa was the most amazing script they had read. So I knew that this should be special because of the story in this one.

Fury Road had some of the better scenes and sequences of any action movie ever, let alone any Mad Max or George Miller movie. But I think overall as a complete movie, this film exceeds what was done on Fury Road. I will be shocked if it doesn't win Best Picture and once again dominate the Academy Awards. Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth were phenomenal and both are deserving of the highest awards and acclaim for their performances. Unfortunately the roles still did not contain enough dialogue that it will be very difficult to win Oscars for those roles. Highly recommend watching this in the best Dolby Atmos theater near you. This makes me want to spend $1000+ on a home Dolby Atmos system. I saw it in both Dolby Cinema and Cinemark XD and I preferred the former. Both were great though.",10.0,29 May 2024
Furiosa!,,8.0,24 May 2024
Mixed feelings,"Movie was good fun - but a little repetitive (road battle, pause, road battle, pause, road battle etc). Anya Taylor-Joy's eyes are certainly very prominent and it was good to see 'Strike' protagonist Tom Burke in a meatily action-packed role. However, this 'Mad Max' outing doesn't have the 'oomph' experienced with 'Fury Road'. I watched the movie in a large cinema at peak viewing time - only eight people in the audience... The movie is split into five chapters, which are 'announced' in quite a clumsy way using text slides - I'd have preferred a subtle (and unannounced) 'cross-fade' from one chapter to the next. It seems that modern movies have to 'signpost' everything for those viewers who can't follow a simple plot (as demonstrated by the literal signing of ""this is Mordor"" in 'LoR - The Rings of Power').

Enjoyed this film, but not as much as I'd expected to.",6.0,29 May 2024
"It is an arthouse grindhouse modern feminist Iliad with classic cars in the desert, perfection.","The level of mythological and biblical allusion, foiled to create a feminist tale of the great hero of our time? Yes. Please watch this movie. It genuinely explores the human condition, the action of myth making, and the power of women in a world ruled by men.

The cast is perfection, from Anya Taylor-Joy (a worthy successor to Charlize Theron) to Chris Hemsworth as snake oil salesman/Christ figure/Tantalus/damned fool Dementus, to everyone else. The visuals and cuts of the movie, the exploration of war as futility, the exploration of hope and redemption in a character brutalized by a world full of cruelty. Please watch.",10.0,3 June 2024
Like a high 8 if I could buy pushed to a 9 as I would like to see more from this Universe,"Film was awesome overall but the ending dragged in my opinion along with the dialogue taking a dip and being cheesey near the end.

Anya Taylor Joy was phenomenal as Furiosa, totally fit the character and added a lot of depth. Alyla Browne as a young Furiosa also had a larger role to play than I thought and was incredible, completely aced the character. Movie was a perfect addition into the Mad Max universe and would love to see other stories as well.

Music was amazing as it pumped the blood and got you involved into the action scenes.

Great cinematography as well, making you feel there, along with fantastic action, especially one good length scene mid-way through the movie which is worth the price of admission alone.

Story was excellent as we learn a lot more about Furiosa and the struggles she had to go through, along with the struggles of the wasteland leading to great world building.

I do believe the end could have been shortened and then the pacing would have been improved overall as it did begin to drag then, tighten it up for a definite 9 or even 10.

Overall, for sure worth the watch.",9.0,27 May 2024
"Over usage of CGI, that also like Animation movie","Action sequence might have been great if they used less CGI, very far from real. Don't know why ladies all the time get sniper and 100% hit the target. Don't like the ending. Previous movie Fury road villan is some kind of Business man here not have big roll, it's only about one lady who is center of CGI action. It lost its main ingredient.dont know how robotic arm works. Taylor acted good in Menu movie but this movie not best fit for her

Fury road hero was great fit to film,after so many years CGI action movie they make, they might have been continued from previous movie, after watching Fury road I thought they release sequel, some Fury road character was there but they are not add anything to movie. For me looks like fashion show movie, cutting hairs, cutting arm and putting new arm, round googles, colouring head,etc etc.",3.0,25 May 2024
A Thrilling Masterpiece in the Mad Max Saga!,"I saw this bombastic film last night and am totally thrilled. Great set design, super script, phenomenal action scenes and, above all, Anya-Taylor Joy delivers a terrific performance as Furiosa. Despite its length, I wasn't bored for a second and the film could have gone on for another hour. Only a few small CGI scenes seem a little fake and jerky, but there were very few and it doesn't detract from the film as a whole. I already loved Fury Road, but Furiose - A Mad Max Saga goes one better.

It's more than rare, especially with newer feature films, but I'd happily watch Furiosa again today in a heartbeat!

I want more!",9.0,24 May 2024
Best movie ever,"""Furiosa"" is a triumph of cinematic vision, a bold and breathtaking expansion of the ""Mad Max"" universe that redefines what an action film can achieve. Directed by the masterful George Miller, this prequel delves into the origins of the iconic character Furiosa, delivering a narrative that is as emotionally compelling as it is visually stunning.

From the opening scene, Miller immerses the audience in a post-apocalyptic wasteland that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. The desolate landscape, with its vast deserts and decaying remnants of civilization, serves as a haunting backdrop to Furiosa's journey. The film's meticulous attention to detail in world-building is evident in every frame, creating an immersive experience that transports viewers into a realm where survival is a constant battle.

Anya Taylor-Joy, as the young Furiosa, delivers a powerhouse performance that is nothing short of transformative. She captures the fierce determination and vulnerability of her character with a depth that resonates deeply. Taylor-Joy's portrayal is both nuanced and powerful, making Furiosa's evolution from a captive to a warrior not only believable but profoundly moving. Her journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and Taylor-Joy embodies this with a raw intensity that is truly compelling.

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Chris Hemsworth delivering a standout performance as the antagonist. Hemsworth's character is complex and multifaceted, providing a formidable foil to Furiosa. His portrayal is chilling, exuding a sense of menace that keeps the audience on edge. The dynamic between Furiosa and Hemsworth's character adds a rich layer of tension and drama to the film, elevating it beyond a mere action spectacle.

Miller's direction is nothing short of visionary. Known for his kinetic and innovative approach to action sequences, he surpasses even his previous work with ""Furiosa."" The film's action scenes are choreographed with breathtaking precision and creativity. Each sequence is a masterclass in tension and excitement, utilizing practical effects and stunts that lend a visceral authenticity to the film. The vehicular mayhem, a hallmark of the ""Mad Max"" series, is executed with exhilarating flair, making every chase and battle pulse with adrenaline.

But ""Furiosa"" is not just a visual feast; it is a narrative triumph as well. The screenplay, penned by Miller and Nico Lathouris, delves deeply into the themes of power, freedom, and identity. It explores Furiosa's backstory with a thoughtful complexity, revealing the events that shaped her into the formidable leader seen in ""Mad Max: Fury Road."" The character development is rich and satisfying, providing emotional weight to the high-octane action.

The film's score, composed by Junkie XL, complements the narrative and visuals perfectly. The music is both haunting and epic, enhancing the emotional and dramatic beats of the story. It's a sonic landscape that mirrors the desolation and hope of the film's world, adding another layer of immersion for the audience.

Cinematographically, ""Furiosa"" is a marvel. The use of color, light, and shadow is masterful, creating a visual tone that is both stark and beautiful. The desaturated palette of the wasteland contrasts strikingly with the vibrant, explosive action sequences, creating a visual experience that is as memorable as it is stunning.

""Furiosa"" is not just a prequel; it is a standalone epic that enriches the ""Mad Max"" mythology while standing firmly on its own merits. It is a film that pushes the boundaries of the action genre, blending intense spectacle with profound storytelling. George Miller has crafted a cinematic experience that is both exhilarating and poignant, a testament to his unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess.

In an era where franchises often prioritize spectacle over substance, ""Furiosa"" is a reminder of what cinema can achieve. It is a film that excites, moves, and inspires. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies ever made, destined to be remembered as a classic that redefined its genre and left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.",10.0,29 May 2024
Another action classic,"George Miller cannot miss. This latest entry in the Mad Max franchise / saga titled Furiosa, is absolutely and fully expectedly incredible from start to finish. Anya Taylor-Joy is such a movie star, and every scene she's in demands attention in the best way possible. I absolutely loved all the action and I think it's about on par with Fury Road. There was slightly more noticeable CGI involved from what I could tell, and the story overall may be a little confusing or rather prolonged in certain sections, but nonetheless, I feel lucky to have witnessed this masterpiece in the cinema. This is a movie that every movie-lover needs to watch on the big screen. Easily one of the best movies of 2024.",9.0,28 May 2024
Great addition to the mad max collection,"I really enjoyed this movie! There was the average plot of revenge like alot of movies but it was definitely done very well! Chris hemms reminded me of hos Thor character at times with his humor but also did a good job being the villian, I would give it a 8-8 1/2 (9 for the haters) definitely worth the watch and keeps you entertained all the way through, it was a great ride,cinematic visually was awesome and there's not much more they coulda did ,a couple tweaks coulda made it perfect but it's a great movie I suggest everyone to go out and see so I won't give a y spoilers and keep it blunt 👍 Good azz fuggin movie!",9.0,26 May 2024
Mad Max still riding strong!,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2024 cause I love the Mad Max Franchise especially Fury Road (2015) and this is yet another strong entry into the Mad Max Franchise and while it's not on the level of greatness of Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) is a lovely ride from start to finish.

The action sequences and stunt work is once again phenomenal which is something you can always expect from the mind of George Miller. The movie's story is by far the most epic in terms of an emotional and personal standpoint. Anya Taylor-Joy is of course spectacular as Furiosa, which is something to expect from one of the best actresses in the business today and while she's not as great as Charlize Theron, her version of Furiosa is able to stand on her own. Chris Hemsworth as Dr. Dementus was hands down the standout performance of the entire movie, he is so crazy and charismatic as this character to the point where even if he is doing horrible things to other characters, you can't help yourself but still love him because he's so captivating as a character.

Overall, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) is yet another phenomenal Blockbuster into the summer of 2024 and I can't wait to see what the rest of this summer has in store for us.",10.0,27 May 2024
Furiosa is a great addition to the Mad Max universe.,"This film did not disappoint. It has been almost 10 years since Fury Road, and I am glad it took that long to produce this, it's that good. This film continues on with George Miller's fantastic world building, fleshing out post-apocalyptic Australia with more of the weird and wonderful things you would(n't) expect.

The actresses who play Furiosa are incredible, from a young girl to grown woman they are able to portray so much emotion from a mostly mute character. Those eyes will show you a world more than words can and that is the main strength of this film.

We read books for words, for dialogue and descriptions. We listen to music for sounds and tremors. Film is a visual art and so much is conveyed visually in it's own unique way. Take for example the citizens of the Citadel, who live in holes in the ground while Immortan Joe towers over them in his Mountain or even the erratic movements of Dementus (done by shooting him independent of the background and speeding it up in segments). These erratic movements are found all over the film giving it that classic janky, crackhead feel that Fury Road had. One thing I found was that this film used a lot more CGI than the last one, or in this film it was much more noticeable. I felt this was a double edged sword as although in parts it looked strange or immersive, in other times it really added to that janky feel the whole film has.

I felt on edge throughout every action scene, choreographed amazingly. At no point did I think 'Oh yeah the good guys are gonna win', it's a rough watch and you really feel like people are surviving out here.

The writing in this film was pretty good, it wasn't laboured and I felt I didnt have to repeat lines in my head like I do with most films. However, my main gripe with this film (so far) is that I'm supposed to believe that between her birth and Fury Road is this huge beef with Dementus? He has impacted her life in such a major way (atleast a decade, if not 2) and is then forgotten and never mentioned again. I guess that's the nature of films in franchises and prequels and you shouldnt think too hard about it.

And big props to Hemsworth. It's the first role I've seen from him outside of Marvel, the character was definitely written for him, but he didn't seem corny. I felt he played his role incredibly.

All in all, a fantastic addition to the Mad Max universe, the franchise is safe in George Miller's hands and I hope a new film is in the works.",8.0,26 May 2024
Mad Max: Furry Lane (Rated NR: Not Rewatchable),"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I went in the theater with high expectations after convincing my self after not being so thrilled about trailer. I found the movie quite boring and characters unrelatable. I kept looking at the time and couldn't wait until the movie was over and I just couldn't find that portion of substance that captures the audience's attention. With some many action sequences, I couldn't find one that really stood out; the only you couldn't wait to watch at home after purchasing the movie in order to watch and rewind and re-watch. I love Mad Max; Fury Road was epic, this was not Fury Road, more like a Furry Lane. Perhaps, this should've been a mini series in MAX.",4.0,25 May 2024
An Electrifying Tale of Female Fury and Vengeance,"Female Rage is the defining theme of 2024, and I'm captivated by the surge of powerful women dominating cinema. ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"" starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, is an adrenaline-fueled roller coaster that vividly depicts the early journey of a young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) leading up to the events of ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""

The film opens with Furiosa being violently torn from her utopian home, situated in the heart of The Wasteland, by the ruthless Dementus (Hemsworth). Dementus is relentless in his quest to force Furiosa into revealing the location of her home of abundance. The narrative then leaps forward to showcase an older Furiosa (Taylor-Joy), who is driven by a fierce desire for vengeance against the man who stole her childhood. The opening act, featuring young Furiosa, is a relentless barrage of action that immerses the audience from the very start. The apocalyptic atmosphere is enhanced by a striking orange tone that persists throughout the film.

Anya Taylor-Joy faced the daunting task of stepping into the role of Furiosa, previously portrayed by Charlize Theron, and she exceeds expectations. Taylor-Joy's performance is imbued with raw, unbridled rage, her intense expressions effectively conveying her character's fury. Chris Hemsworth brings Dementus to life with vigor, unexpected humor, and a distinctive prosthetic nose. The chemistry between Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth is palpable, creating a dynamic and engaging on-screen rivalry. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances, adding depth to the immersive experience.

The cinematography in ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" rivals that of ""Dune: Part 2."" Each shot is meticulously crafted, bursting with color and detail. The film's many vehicle chase scenes, which constitute a significant portion of the narrative, are particularly compelling. The sound mixing is another standout feature, elevating the overall cinematic experience. Given the technical prowess on display, I anticipate ""Furiosa"" will garner numerous nominations in the 2024 awards season.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a must-see on the biggest screen possible. With its stellar performances, breathtaking cinematography, and immersive sound design, the film offers an unforgettable journey into The Wasteland. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.",10.0,28 May 2024
"Was apprehensive, but that was a mistake.","Mad Max 2 was one of the first 18 certificate movies I remember my parents allowing me to watch... as I was into dystopia, post-apoc table top gaming. At 42 the franchise has been at the forefront of my favourite movies for most of my life.

When Fury Road was released i was apprehensive, but proved wrong as I loved it every bit as the originals. Then I hear a Furiosa prequel is being done, and I'm well on board. Then the first trailer dropped and I just wasn't sold. However, I like Chris Hemsworth and Anna TJ. It's still directed by Miller so I'm still game.

Glad to say it was outstanding! Now in my opinion, I prefer Fury Road, and MM 1+2 clearly. (Thunderdrome is fine). However this is still great, and in many ways more akin to the first Mad Maxs than Fury Road was. More revenge, more development. Fury Road was a nonstop chase movie, with little breathing space... and that was its beauty. This is more 'act' based, characters go through 'stuff', there are moments of action built around a more structured narrative. Rather than, hit the gas... chase... GO!!!

All actors are superb. The cinematography is awesome, my initial of too much CGI was unfair. Most of it works great, and enhances the practical effects and outstanding stuntwork. Again I was worried about romance plots... but it was done beautifully.

All in all a great film. Miller clearly cares about his franchise. This is no Terminator, Die Hard etc, which years on from the gorgeous originals have lost their way and completely disregard good story telling or what made them work in the first place. Please Miller give me more.",9.0,27 May 2024
One of the best prequels,"The script for Furiosa was written along with the script for Fury Road and it can be felt here. A lot of things in Fury Road get a lot more weight after watching this movie. And it's not like other franchises where the prequel is designed to do that. Here it really feels like Fury Road really came after this and does not retroactively fit into the narrative. Anya Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth were just killing it here. Anya has proven multiple times how great she is but Hemsworth really comes out of his pretty boy image and shows his range in a pretty complex character. The lightheartedness he brings at moments show no sign of his Marvel roles and his dialogues at the end could have been disastrous if not handled well. But the real star is of course George Miller, that man is a crazy genius. His handle on different aspects of direction is again at full display here. The incredible action, the way he directs actors and so many spectacular editing choices are used which are not enough in cinema and a lot of times feel wrongly used, but he uses everything brilliantly.

One of the best action scenes of recent times was happening and in the middle of it, the theatre decided to give an interval, which is the only negative thing I experienced.

Although, I feel like there could be many who would be disappointed a bit if they expect exactly another Fury Road. This is much more of a story in chapters than a complete adrenaline-pumping movie. The action and chase scenes are incredible and do form a significant part of the movie, but it takes its time for the characters and drama too. Especially the ending not being too big and using the kind of dialogue it had may not work for a lot of people. But it was phenomenal for me. The best movie of the year so far. Watching Fury Road after this would be even more effective in my opinion.",9.0,23 May 2024
Amazing visuals. Must see in IMAX,"This is a movie to be seen and enjoyed on a large screen. The action sequences are very good.

The movie however was a bit too long. I found myself looking at the watch towards the end and wondering when it would get over.

The story itself was meh. Though I was interested in in Furiosa's journey and all scenes were good I think they should have made some tough decisions and shortened the movie for todays attention deficit generation.

Chris Hemsworth was interesting in a negative role. But the real hero of this movie were the stunts, the cars and the sequences on the fury road itself. I liked the sandstorm scene also.",9.0,27 May 2024
A beautiful disappointment,"I recently watched this film and, while it didn't meet my expectations in many ways as i was expecting brainless action heavy film with little story and dialogue, it was still really great film taking a different approach compared to the first. This time, it focused more on dialogue and character development, making it feel almost like a biography (it's not). The villain was great, Chris's performance was so convincing that I found myself questioning if it was really him as I didn't know he can act. Charlee Fraser was the standout in the film for me, and I wished she had more screen time. The direction was excellent, as expected, and the story was well written. Overall, it's a great film, but I still found myself wanting something more akin to the first film's action-packed style.

AND NO, DON'T WATCH IT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.",9.0,25 May 2024
Slow and Dark is the story of this race.,"I have to admit that my desire to see this movie comes from how epic Mad Max Fury Road was. One of the greatest action films I ever seen the 2015 movie is definitely a thrill ride.

This almost set me a stray with Furiosa as i watched it. Unlike any other Mad Max film Furiosa is a direct prequel to Fury Road taking place fully in the exact same universe (Although I want to note how much Beyond Thunderdome was referenced in Both Fury Road and Furiosa). I could help but to get in the theatre thinking I'm going to get the same effect from George Miller that I got with his last Mad Max outing.

However, the speed in particular of this movie was slow in compassion to the fast past non stop kinetic feel of Fury Road. It was obvious with the first action sequence in the first few minutes.

Another noticeable difference is a tone between both movies. As it says in the title Mad Max is mad and Furiosa is Furious going down the Fury Road. These two emotions lend well to brutal action in part four.

Furisoa is a different emotion of bleakness as we go through her entire origin story, from childhood to an adult. If you seen Mad Max 4 the movie even feels darker knowing how she got to that point. Plus the burtalness in that slow pace was actually more enhanced.

Goerge Miller visioned a movie with that bleakness. He's using the same composer from the last movie and this score lends to what is happening to Furisoa exactly like it did for Fury Road. I felt the CGI was a bit more obvious in this film than what seemed like more practical effects in Fury Road but it did add to the drama of the film.

Speaking of Drama Anna Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemmsworth were perfect. Hemmsworth seem like the perfect joker-like borderline of funny and villainous perfect for an Ozzi film in my personal opinion. I now cannot unsee Anna Taylor-joy as Furiosa, I could not image what Charlize Theron would do with the project at this point.

I definitely liked Fury Road better which is definitely not fair to this Mad Max saga as both movies are giving off different energy so I will say don't go into the theatre expecting that high octane energy and keep in mind that Furiosa's story is emotionally draining, like Black Swan emotionally draining, but it was worth the drain.",9.0,24 May 2024

Furisouly Action Packed,"LIKES:

The Story Matching Up To The Previous Movie

The Costumes/Wardrobe/Makeup

The Acting

The Music

The Sound Effects

The Visuals/Designs

The Comedy To A Degree

The Character Development

The Surprise Pacing

Several Action Sequences

Summary: A lot of likes for this one, Furiosa's campaign is loaded with quality that makes going to the movies fun for a viewer like me. For fans of the story, you'll be pleased to get a familiar feel for the Mad Max world, and like the connections and references to the kingdoms most of Hardy's movies played with. I need a rewatch, but I felt most of them kept to the lore and continuity well without getting too lost in making sure everything was exact. Our leading lady's story holds a lot of good moments, especially the movie's opening half, and I loved the emotions conveyed by Taylor-Joy's solid performance (alongside her younger counterpart). This blend of entertainment and lore building was solid, and the acting continues to be right on the part with Miller's direction for being deep, but not too deep. Hemsworth had fun with this role, and I laughed a bunch at how different a role he played in this movie, finding his delivery uncouth, insane, and ambitious to be the perfect villain for a film. Burke's classiness has been curtailed to fit quite well in this world, almost like a Mad Max persona himself without as much of the insanity or rogue nature.

The main cuisine comes in the form of special effects for me, which have really stepped on the gas over the last decade. Furiosa is splendid in making this world shine as it illustrates: horrendous cannibalistic cults, harsh desert marauders and groups, epic vehicles and mashed-up monstrosities, and disease-ravaged warriors. Costumes are crips and tight to fit the ""punk"" era apocalyptic theme, while our characters still maintain enough humanity to become overly fake and phony. The action scenes (particularly in Acts 1, 3, and 4) show this off beautifully bringing high-quality sound-editing, epic musical scores, and dynamic visuals together to make some of the better action sequences. Designing the rigs and vehicles was awesome to me, alongside the choreography, Miller and his crew have put up a stylish movie that is every bit as chaotic as the content, and I loved it. Totally worth the theater visit, this is the level of entertainment that the movies were made for (so long as you can handle the rated-R material).

DISLIKES:

Too Much In One Movie

Stories Truncated A Bit At Times

Editing

Bloated At The End

Some Visuals Get A tad Artificial Looking

SUMMARY: While a magnificent movie of splendor and excitement, the movie did have just a few things that I did not like. Visual-wise (again assuming you can handle this style) a few times the CGI effect takes hold and looks fake, but this is minor compared to other movies. No, the main thing has to do with some of the storytelling in this movie. While it adds up at the end, Furiosa's five acts sometimes feel incomplete or heavily edited. Stories that are just starting quickly get dropped to an action sequence or (in most cases) lost to a quick time-lapse to the closing part of that story. There was so much to see and do. So many characters to engage with and planning, but it was very diluted and rushed for much of the movie. I won't say much to avoid spoilers, but most should see the avenues where the story took a dive or seemed to have to make last-minute cuts to make the time. The exception would be the ending, where most of the last 25-30 minutes felt very drawn out into speeches that hold a lot of character-testing value, but are slow, sluggish, and a bore after the adrenaline rush. Perhaps this movie needed two parts or a mini-series to solve this, but it felt like it had a lot to tell in a short time.

THE VERDICT: This film was indeed a spectacle that I had a lot of fun with. Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa was only the start of what I liked about this film that used its big budget on effects well to craft the chaotic world of Mad Max. High-octane thrill rides with loud engines are amazing, and the storytelling suits to meet the ends together for the Hardy movie to pick up, but yet still be its own thing to explain the hardships of our driving queen. Its main dislike is too much in one movie and cutting so much just when it was getting good to cram so much in. Outside of a few moments, the pacing is entertaining, and the action will more than makeup things for most when all is said and done. As I've said several times, this is a theater trip for those who are fans of this type of movie.

My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5.",8.0,24 May 2024
Anya Taylor-Joy is perfect in this high-octane Mad Max prequel.... Brilliant!,"I'll be straight up from the start, I genuinely had some reservations going into this movie when I read that Anya Taylor-Joy was the lead for this film, because as much as I respect her acting ability and talent, I just couldn't see how she would fit this role. She was excellent, and so I'm eating plenty of humble pie here. It has to be just put out there from the start.

Anya Taylor-Joy is the crux of the film as the lead protagonist Furiosa, whose back-story we are discovering after being introduced in the last movie. The film is just incredible. The run-time just flies by and you just love it all. The storyline, the humour, the dialogue and the action just flows perfectly along throughout the entire run-time, and you will be engrossed.

It's filmed almost perfectly, and everything fits in spectacularly This is a film made for cinema too, and the sound with the big screen action just goes together so well.

I can't speak highly enough of this. A wonderful and surprise addition to the Max Max story.

Really give it a try. Highly recommended.",8.0,27 May 2024

A hugely impressive and entertaining experience,"George Miller knocks it out of the park once again with a riotously entertaining and rich follow up to Fury Road.

Serving as a prequel, Furiosa follows the titular warrior in her earlier years, tracking her journey from the 'place of the abundance' to becoming embroiled in the power struggle between Immortan Joe and newcomer to the franchise Dementus. It's a thrilling story with great world building and a wildly entertaining collection of characters. It's final act is a tad drawn out, but aside from this the story and pacing are near flawless.

As mentioned the characters are superbly crafted. Furiosa was played so well and written so perfectly in Fury Road, yet somehow that brilliance is matched in this film. It's rare that a prequel genuinely adds interesting and important layers to a character, but Furiosa really does get under the skin of this character and makes Fury Road a much better watch as a result. Anya Taylor Joy gives a powerful performance, but is upstaged by the maniacal performance of Chris Hemsworth. Miller gave him a peach of a role in Dementus and he rose to the challenge and then some. It's just terrific in every way.

The action is probably one of the main things drawing people to this film and you won't be disappointed. The sequences are long, loud, and incredibly entertaining and inventive. Watching a film like this makes you realise how many other films coast by with their action sequences. The standard is being set by Miller in these Mad Max films that's for sure.

Stylistically this film is very similar to Fury Road, which is only a good thing as the creative choices made in that film were outstanding. Everything from the costumes, colour palettes, tone, energy of this film is just spot on. It makes for such a rich and engaging experience in every way.

If you had any kind of positive feeling towards Mad Max Fury Road, then you will share that sentiment for this film. Lightning really does strike twice as Miller shows once again that he is at the vanguard of the big screen action epic.",9.0,27 May 2024
A worthy follow-up/prequel,"I was cautiously optimistic Furiosa would be great, with enthusiasm being dulled a little by seeing some reviews that came across as a little disappointed (still, no one saying it was outright bad at least). I think this tempered my expectations a little, and I went in expecting something slow and less spectacular than Fury Road, but honestly, I came away from Furiosa liking it almost as much as that previous film.

It isn't as relentless or white-knuckle, and it's not as pure of an action movie, but I honestly think the amount of action in both films is comparable. Furiosa felt non-stop at times, even a lot of the time... just not all the time, owing to the film trying to do something different this time around. Ultimately, this is a good thing.

The stopping and starting of action would be a flaw if the downtime, so to speak, was boring, but I really enjoyed most of the non-action scenes here too. This is the Mad Max movie that feels the most like an epic so far (a character even says the word here, near the end), and I think it earns its 2.5-hour runtime. A full-scale war plays out alongside the title character's story, almost feeling like two movies in one that also intersect at points. I could understand missing the purity and simplicity of Fury Road, but I liked the different things George Miller was trying to do here.

The action often feels like ""more Fury Road,"" and that's honestly okay with me. There's an extended chase scene around the halfway mark that feels like an excuse for Miller to cram in some of the crazy stuff he couldn't fit into Fury Road, and it's super entertaining. The escalation of it all was wonderful.

It's ambitious and doesn't entirely stick the landing of every single thing it's going for, and I wonder whether some of the callbacks/call-forwards will feel clunkier as time goes on. Still, for now, that doesn't matter. I was engrossed in this for two and a half hours and I found it a joy to see Miller do his thing; here's a guy who's still able to execute a bold vision perfectly on screen, and put a massive budget to good use. This feels a lot more finely crafted than most blockbusters (best blockbuster of the year is still Dune 2, though), the cast's great, the action's fun, and the ambitious story was engaging.

I think it's a pretty significant success, and not too far off Fury Road quality-wise. That being said, I would like to revisit that 2015 film and then see Furiosa once more in cinemas, just to see if my thoughts will change in any way.",9.0,24 May 2024
Grounded story with Super acting and VFX. Must watchable in theatres,"The VFX set and locations are real and good, the acting of chris Hemsworth as a villain he performed excellently. There is a characters of previous movie Mad Max fury road but it's limited scenes only. Especially Immortan Joe screen time is limited and his two sons little bit performs extendly but they too limited. The main story focus on Furiosa and Demantos (Chris Hemsworth). But the story was not like Mad Max fury road and it was straight forward story happened on a single time. But this movie was a biography of Furiosa. So the story happens sequely on both furiosa side as well as Demantos side. The road chase is another big action treat. Miller sculptured these action sequences.

The movie is watchable at theatres and it worth it. Because it has a strong story and acting and best visual treat. All the scenes are grounded like fury road movie. Nothing is imaginary so logics are perfectly handled. The negative is Anya Tyler -joy is not perfectly suited for furiosa and she had to convey the story through emotions because she had limited speech. She fails to convey full emotions.",9.0,23 May 2024

George miller at best!,"This movie is amazingly great! Not at the level of fury road probably (but that one is a masterpiece) but gosh George miller, Anya, Chris...they put everything into this and it shows! It's an epic blockbuster, people should go watching it, not just being hyped for Deadpool 3 and then keep complaining about the lack of Hollywood good quality movies...

Furiosa Is pure passion, with a structure that is super traditional but also quite quirky and original. Same for the action, the music (very dark), and the images ...

It gave me apocalypse now vibes, quiet dark movie, with some scenes that stuck in your head,not talking just about action scenes...

Go see it in cinema, but a good cinema (with laser projector and good surround at least). The Dolby Atmos mix was dynamite and you simply can't do that at home, even with an oled TV...so stop complaining about Hollywood, take your butt off the couch and go see it in dolby cinema ! The scope cinematography was also a blast in a scope screen!

The drought is over!,"Going in, I kept my expectations in check as I couldn't possibly believe George Miller could out due himself after Fury Road.

Well, I have never been happier to be wrong! Furiosa is everything that I have been dying to see in the Mad Max world.

While Fury Road is George Miller's psychotic vision of Mad Max come to life. Furiosa is the detail, is the fine painting from a masterclass film maker.

I was not prepared in the slightest for how much deeper Miller was taking Furiosa. To the world building, the story, and its action.

This film brought to mind all the classic epics of the 1950s and 60s because of its deliberate slow pacing and its storytelling. It felt like an odyssey for the life of Furiosa, and I was all for it! Unfortunately, though, because of the films nature, I highly doubt this will appeal to the general audience.

I have very few to no complaints about this film except to say I do wish Miller relied more on practical effects than cgi. Also, I would have liked to have some more crazy action akin to Fury Road, but the action made sense for Furiosa, and it was fantastic.

Finally, I can not close this review without mentioning the cast. Anya Taylor-Joy was fantastic as young Furiosa she nailed this role. Chris Hemsworth's role as odd I as I thought it was going to be was fantastic. Hemsworth was amazing as Dementus, and while he's not the strongest villain or antagonist in the Mad Max world, he was perfect for Furiosa. Then, of course, seeing all the characters back from Fury Road was an amazing cherry on top.

There's so much good in this film and so much to talk about and unpack that I could go on but I will stop my review here and say with a smile on my face that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the first film to recieve the highest score I have given and will probably give this year.

I also give George Miller a genuine thank you from the deepest part of my heart for helping me return some faith in the art of film and cinema. So thank you, George, thank you!

The prequal to Fury road that noone asked for,"I wasnt expecting much having seen the trailers with Chris Hemsworth goofing around in his usual comedic style. His nose prostetic and dark eyes didnt make things better. Why they decided to costumise him that way is a mystery, but I think it made the movie look less serious.

The movie is as mentioned a prequal to Mad Max Fury Road. We get to see what led Furuosa to that point. Why would that be interesting you might ask, well the only reason I can find is to promote the idea that women are equals or better than men, because that seems to be the theme of this movie. Men are shown as incredibly dumb in a chaotic world where they are dying like flies in an endless stream.

Acting is decent but there isnt much of it. Everyone are either playing someone mentally challenged or carry a stoneface. The focus of the action is mostly on things blowing up, men dying, car and motorcycle chases and the rare occasional dialogue between the mentally challenged.

Camera is excellent though, we get to see wide shots matched with closeups when its relevant. Scenography is also good. Music and sound isnt much of anything but it does its part.

The story is this movies weak point. Its shallow and pointless.

What would make you want to watch this movie might be Anya Taylor-Joy but you wont see much of her. Shes played by other people in the first one third of the movie and later she is mostly a covered up stoneface, so thats that.

In summary I fail at finding this movie interesting. There is no beauty in the movie, just savagery and depravation.

"Different, Gutsy, Well Made","I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. From what I had read and seen, I was concerned. I heard Anya Taylor Joy (ATJ) didn't appear until an hour in, and the CGI looked iffy. However, I was pleasantly surprised!! This is an incredible character driven action film. Knowing that George and Nick wrote this BEFORE FURY ROAD to develop Furiosa's character is even more bonkers. Chris Hemsworth is scary good as the psychopathic(?) or sociopathic war lord, Dementus. He lives up to his name and steals the show! The amount of character Furiosa has is quite impressive, and even more so when you learn she only has like 30 lines of dialogue. There is excellent visual storytelling, and my favorite sequence might be the Bullet Town section. Regarding the CGI, it looks weird, yeah, but I would argue it works because it is consistent throughout in its style. Really, the problem isn't the CGI itself, but the lighting mismatch from on the set and the background. It's weird but it works in its own way. I wonder how much was shot on one of those LED walls instead of a green screen, where they could fix more in post? I am positive it won't look as bizarre in the black and chrome edition.

How does it compare to fury road? The argument is kinda invalid, as they're wildly different movies. I just rewatched fury road after this one, and I have to say I appreciated and enjoyed fury road more this time around-not because I thought, ""man, I wish they could have done THAT again,"" but because I knew Furiosa's character better. Much of my complaints before about Fury Road, and why I haven't rewatched it as many times as The Road Warrior, was the lack of character development. It's just driving from A to B, then back to A. Here we get to know Furiosa. We see how her brain works, how she survives. It was gutsy having the young her on screen for the first hour, but I think it was a great move. I liked her and Jack. And Jack was, I have to say, also really hot. I think it's the makeup with the upper half of his face being covered in black oil(?). It definitely added to his character and costume. Same with Furiosa. Without her makeup, I would have felt like I was just watching ATJ in Furiosa cosplay.

I'm sad this film isn't doing as well in the box office. I don't think it's because it's a female lead, I think it's because it's an origin story. Also the marketing didn't do the film justice. It ""showed the whole movie"" while simultaneously painting a different picture of what to expect with the movie. I would like to look more into what happened there.

In conclusion, Chris Hemsworth is scary and steals the show, the storytelling has guts of steel, the 2.5 hour runtime passes rather quickly, and I enjoy fury road even more now after seeing this: because this adds to the lore and builds the characters in ways which that film was unable to. I mean, it's 30 minutes longer and spans much more than the course of, what, 36 hours? Sure, it ""could have been better"" I guess. I think we first see Immortan Joe in just a standard closeup, as opposed to his bad ass intro in Fury Road. But, I mean, these are tiny details that enhance an already great story. Don't complain about CGI, complain to Disney for oversaturating the industry with unnecessary VFX, and support the unionization of VFX artists! Sorry that I threw that message in last minute, but I just can't stand people complaining about CGI when we as a community can actually do something about it!

8.6/10 Solid ending btw. I like the mythological aspect of it. Voiceover surprisingly worked. I also enjoyed George's other film, Three Thousand Years of Longing. I can definitely see how that film influenced this one. He's such a great artist.",8.0,1 June 2024
Surprisingly great,"George Miller delivers a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road that was marketed poorly but has lots of great qualities and actually stands its ground.

This movie had the worst Memorial Day release in 3 years, but the reviews are overall positive. I personally thought the trailers and marketing did not do a great job. It looked cheesy and botched and like they scrapped together another action movie with big names. However, I am very happy to say that I was very wrong about that. Running at 2 hours 30 minutes, this movie is action packed from the beginning to end. While yes they have big names like Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, Anya doesn't even appear until an hour in, and Hemsworth is almost unrecognizable. Everyone else is a character actor that is completely immersed in the world of this wasteland. Every character was interesting and so well played that it was sometimes scary how real the performances felt.

One of my first thoughts was that the camera work that Miller is known for in Fury Road did not carry the same sexiness that it did in that film. The shaky cam in the middle of action scenes making people look like they were moving faster than they really were looked more like a video game than interesting. Those were the only scenes that I was taken out of the movie, it just felt very fake to me. I appreciate that he was trying to keep the same style, but it didn't hit like the last film. There were also a couple of time that I questioned why someone was in a scene, or why Furiosa made the decisions that she did. I appreciated that she was a near silent character, but I needed a little bit more to understand her motivations and desires by the end.

Overall, I was very pleased with this. The action was intense, unique and had me on the edge of my seat for a full 2 hours and 30 minutes- truly didn't even wonder when it was going to end. Set design, script, editing, it was all very well done and deserves more praise and people in the theatres to see it. I loved how it ended right where Fury Road picks up, too. Just a really interesting and near flawless story and lead up into the franchise.",8.0,30 May 2024
Nothing to do with Mad Max...nothing.,"Who asked for this movie? Who wanted it? Why did they include the words 'Mad Max' in the title, when the film has absolutely NOTHING to do with Max Rockatansky?

The film is an overly-bloated nothing burger at almost 2.5 hours long, and never really gets going until well after the 00:35 minute mark. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the origin story of Furiosa, a character that was a sem-interesting in the last Mad Max film, Fury Road. Her tragic and violent childhood is well-told, to be sure. But the question you will keep asking yourself is this: Did I ever really care enough about Furiosa to sit here for two and a half hours?

The action sequences never stack up to Fury Road, and the film liberally uses CGI...way too much, in my opinion. The best thing about Furiosa is the role of Immortan Joe, who thankfully has plenty of screen time to keep you at least fairly interested in what happens in the next scene.

This movie predictably BOMBED at the box office. Why? Because nobody wants to see another movie with the name 'Mad Max' in it that doesn't actually star 'Mad' Max Rockatansky. If you want box office success, then give us another Max movie with Mel Gibson and give the character the proper respectful send off it deserves.",3.0,30 May 2024
Not even Mediocre..,"The movie feels like a check list of items to cover about Furiousa's backstory, but remains devoid of any natural character development. Instead of bringing color and depth to Furiousa's hate for Imorten Joe, the story is muddled with villains and story lines that lack depth or relevance. For a movie all about her, I felt no connection to the character, her pain, or her motivations; I don't care whether she escapes or if she makes it home... Furiousa was full of raw emotion in Fury Road and this movie would have done well if it had built up to that depth of drive throughout the film. Not to mention it's gorishly violent without any satisfying action.

Second worst film I have ever seen. Terrible.,"I have been a Mad Max fan since I saw Road Warrior aged about 11. I enjoyed Fury Road and went to see this movie with an open mind. It is in fact probably the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema. Totally incoherent waste of time. Massively over-long. The introductory episode takes forever to complete and barely sets up any of the characters properly. Badly scripted. Embarrassing even. Could have been written by a 15 year-old. In fact, possibly was. Taylor-Joy barely gets any lines at all. The chase scenes are ruined by CGI. Impossibly illogical plot holes. Bad script. Hemsworth's nose is a joke. Millions on CGI and they couldn't be bothered to hide the prosthetic join. What has happened to Miller??? The only decent action sequence is the first rig chase which is a carbon copy of the climactic scene in the Road Warrior. I miss the gritty real world apocalypse of the original movies. It's taken Max into the Marvel world of soupy CGI sickeningly high levels of explosions and almost no story line at all. A film for little boys obsessed with video games.

"What a waste of great actors, characters, and story potential","Watch Mad Max: Fury Road again instead, you'll have a better experience and imagine a better back story. Instead of all the glorious practical effects of the last movie this is a yawn inducing stretched out piece of CGI taffy. A good movie might have been in something half the run time, but instead it gives half the action and a tenth of the story in a drawn out meaningless blast of testosterone that carries essentially the opposite meaning of the previous film. It tells you nothing new about the Vuvalini or Immortan Joe. Spending all its time instead on new characters who mostly go nowhere. It continuously plants the seeds for better story lines without paying them off and shows set ups for significantly smarter courses of action that it then ""surprises"" you with by taking the dumber course of action. The acting is stellar. The setting is grand. But the story limps along like it wants to be 2001: A Space Odyssey, just in the desert. I feel like the movie was started by a better film maker and finished up by an AI that just spewed out a mangled version of the last film to fill in the gaps without understanding in the slightest what made the last movie one of the best action movies of all time. I went in knowing this movie probably couldn't live up and was still massively disappointed.",4.0,2 June 2024
Embarrassing,"I'm a huge fan of Chris Hemsworth but his 'acting' in this movie was AWFUL! I'm an Australian and both my mother and I were CRINGING hard whenever he opened his mouth! Tom Burke, a British actor did a MUCH better Aussie accent than Chris did with his ridiculously over-exaggerated 'bogan' voice. He's SOOOO unbelievable as a villain! He enjoyed it more than any other role he had done so good for him.

Look. I adore Hemsy to bits SO MUCH. He's one my fav celebs EVER and is a good role model but he should seriously stop it with the fake accents in movies as he is AWFUL at them and his movements were cringe worthy. It's truly hard to believe that he has a Hollywood Star and not a more accomplished actor such as Robert Downey Jr!

Tom Burke truly surprised us with how good his Australian accent was and he did more justice to this Australian movie than Chris Hemsworth did!

"Much like the desert at night, this movie was cold and makes you fall asleep.","So let's make it clear. I am not saying this is the worst movie ever. But it's the worst in the Mad Max universe.

Oh where to begin. The CGI felt... off for some reason in this. The story was just really bland for some reason. It really didn't add anything of value.

But perhaps the biggest issues is the characters. Furiosa, who is the big main person after all its named after, was just a bore to watch. Like some cold robot instead of her could have made you feel more emotion. Furiosa just seemed to lack any emotion in anyway. She felt cold and off putting. You didn't really feel anything for her or compelled to care.

Movies tend to have an arc the characters go through. Some growth, emotion...etc that makes you feel connected. Furiosa at the end was the same as at the start. To be fair, she was kinda cold and emotionless in Fury Road though.

Total Waste from Hollywoods Wasteland,"Wow, Watched this with my son and 2 brothers and their sons. We brothers have seen all the Max movies and they have only seen the one prior to this- which none of them thought was better than a bad episode of Dexter( yes, my nephew said that). We hoped this would at least be an okay watch but no it was just plain bad and by 20 minutes in my son and nephews had left saying they could stand no more, while we three tried to find something in it to like. Well, we made it to the end and were disappointed in the bad acting, worse script and the time we lost and how this diminishes the awesomeness of the first three Max movies. There are no spoilers in this review because you just can't spoil a movie this bad because there is nothing to really good to mention. Avoid this as it will probably be the nail in the coffin for the Max series, but if you do want to torture yourself, wait till it's on DVD or some late night cable channel and watch it alone- but close your blinds first, and lower the volume-you don't want your neighbors to know what you are watching.",1.0,30 May 2024
Perfectly Mediocre,"I was very excited for the movie, I watched Mad Max Fury Road beforehand and Furiosa was one of my favorite characters, the way she played off of Mad Max and the non stop action.

Furiosa starts off slow, which makes sense since it's more of an origin story but there seems to be a rather strong sense to linger on parts that the audience could easily imagine or fill in themselves, and not enough focus on the things that make the character exciting and badass. She seems to breeze through most of it, you never have a sense of urgency or concern. Certainly you know because it's a prequel she's going to survive but she hardly seems to have a rough time of it at all.

I have to admit, I walked out of the movie about 30 minutes before it ended, having checked my cloak and compared it to the run time. Between the horrid pacing and the exceptionally lackluster CGI, it made the entire movie including its action sequences feel muted. The sound stage, the sensation of being in it. People sweating, fighting against the forces of the cars, you can see which parts were filmed on a stationary vehicle as opposed to a lot of the actual stunts used in Fury Road.

Unfortunately - not impressed...,"The movie was if nothing else loud and brutal. But in my opinion it did mot make it up to the standards of Mad Max: Fury Road.

It was not a total disappointment, but I don't think I would recommend it. It was also hard to imagine that this Furiosa will become the Charlize Theron's Furiosa. Like there is a whole universe between the two actresses and they depict her character with different depth and honesty. And I definitely prefer the Charlize's Furiosa.

Distinctly average,"I was eager to enjoy this film, but it was all style and no substance.

The first 30 to 40 minutes were engaging with a fast pace, but after the first hour, the story lacked depth, and the pace fell flat.

The focus was solely on action, with Hollywood-style explosions and V8 engines. While some action sequences were impressive, ultimately, only one scene stood out.

The sound and visuals were outstanding, making it a must-see in the cinema. Arguably, ""Furiosa"" should only be watched in the cinema.

Chris Hemsworth delivered a standout performance, elevating the film. When he was on screen, the film shone, but in his absence, it was almost unwatchable.

The story lacked substance and dragged on for over two and a half hours for a simple tale of revenge.

Anna Taylor-Joy, who excelled in ""The Queen's Gambit,"" failed to impress in this film. Her character was unlikeable and lacked charisma, making it challenging to root for her. Considering the film is named after her character, this significantly detracted from the movie.

Furiosa is an ""average"" film at best. It will win awards for effects and sounds, but if you like a good story, or a film that is more than costumes and explosions, I'd give it a swerve.",5.0,27 May 2024

.. I had great expectations for it because watching Fury Road was like experiencing a middle of an EPIC battle with minimum background, so I kinda hoped to see an EPIC background in Furiosa which was not there for me.

.. I don't know why I wanted to care less about gaslands and bullet farms, I wanted to see more of Furiosa, and guess what you don't get to see Anya for 40+ min! There are so much time wasted on less important details that I wished were invested in getting to know Furiosa better, and hating her enemies more.

.. If you love Fury Road so much and you compare it to Furiosa you will be disappointed at the time wasted on watching Furiosa... and if you don't compare them and just want to just watch a good movie, you will be also disappointed cause it is really boring!",3.0,3 June 2024

Disappointingly monotonous,I really liked it for about the first 30 mins with some good acting but the rest of the film relied mainly on CGI. A shame as Hemsworth acts v well creating a very diverse and crazy character. It however became boring as it was the same scenes with little spoken acting. It felt as if it was never ending and quite a long film. Yes of course it was gonna be a fuel and violence fest which is fine but this was monotonous. As if cinema goers really don't care about acting anymore. The storyline also became very loose as it went from fight seen in the desert to another fight scene in the desert etc etc.,4.0,25 May 2024
kinda boring,"Chris hemsworth is in real danger now of being typecast, here he play another muscle bound clown, silly jokes, silly teeth. For me the story just didn't get going or go anywhere really, after 20 minutes it was just more of the same and got boring. Anya is not in the move until well over half way and is well, underwhelming, this trend of casting waif like women as bad ass action fighters is just plain dumb, shes climbing over thing, under things, hand to hand fighting, firing guns and she doesn't have an ounce of muscle on her, please just stop.

Repetitive. Monotonous. Unfulfilling.,"Alright, I decided to write this review to see if I can put my thoughts into words.

I didn't like this movie, and I honestly think it is overhyped. It is, at best, an average film that is nowhere near as engaging and entertaining as its predecessor, ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""

By no means am I the biggest Mad Max fan or even a knowledgeable connoisseur of its lore and world. Nonetheless, I am a film fan who loves action and, above all, the feeling of being blown away by a story in a movie theater. I've watched ""Fury Road"" a couple of times now, and it deserves all its recognition and its place in the high rankings of action movies. It's memorable, epic, and revolutionary.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is not.

Ever since I first watched the initial trailer for this film, I found myself slightly disappointed, mainly by the look of the movie. I held out hope they were still working on the post-production to refine the cinematography, but no-what we see in the trailer is what we get: an overproduced, highly artificial, sanitized-looking movie that distances itself, in a negative way, from the original that came out nearly a decade ago.

I can't remember where I heard it, but this sums it up perfectly: ""'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga' looks as if Robert Rodriguez's 'Spy Kids' was directed on a much higher budget.""

That's the truth.

With that out of the way, I think the biggest issue for me overall was the story that was offered to us, or at least how it was conducted. ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" follows a plot that has been done an infinite number of times yet never gets old (if done right): it's a revenge story. However, this revenge story felt extremely dull and monotonous, lacking emotion and dragging itself through its unnecessarily long runtime.

How can a movie like this feel so tedious? I asked myself the same thing. After all, the franchise cemented itself as the gold standard of mind-blowing entertainment in 2015, right? But as we know, lightning in a bottle can't be caught twice. Repetitive and uninspired are the two words I can best use to describe the entirety of the film.

I must say it's impossible to judge this movie without paying attention to the action set pieces, as they are crucial elements of the narrative and the main driving force behind the franchise. All I can say is that after leaving the theater, I couldn't recall a single scene that kept me on the edge of my seat or truly made my heart race.

In a story where the setting diversification is already very limited, with our characters being tied only to the desert wasteland, creativity has to play a key part in order for each set piece feel distinct from the other. Here, however, it all feels like rinse and repeat. Nothing is fresh, and after the second or third action lackluster scene, you inevitably start to yawn.

I could go on about how lengthy the film is and how it shows, or how hard it becomes to connect with Furiosa as a main character since she hardly ever shows any emotion, but I would end up writing longer than I initially thought I would.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is, unfortunately, a very unnecessary film. We would all have been better off with a movie that advanced Max's story or, better yet, just let ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" stand on its own.

I swear I just couldn't stand any more of those ""impact explosions""! Where did the creativity go?!

That's just my opinion, though. I really wish I could have enjoyed it more than I did. :)",5.0,30 May 2024
"Worst movie made sine Dune2, and almost as boring","This is an autrocious movie with some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The production value is about on the same level as a 4th grade school play, camera work horrible, sound design abysmal, and the story, omg... the story...

Dune2 is the worst movie I have seen in years, and this is almost as bad, and in many ways very similar. Lots of sand, lots of bad acting, lots of evildoers who are extremely incompetent, lots of things that make no sense and plot holes in every corner. I didn't think Anna-Taylor Joy could make a mistake and be part of a horrible movie, but yet here we are.

Any redeeming traits? Well, this is unintentionally funny. The acting is so bad I was laughing out loud several times. This is an amazing movie to do a drinking game to - take a shot every time someone is bad at acting and you will be dead before the 40min mark.

A very generous 2/10 since it is not the worst movie I have seen. But this is bad, really, really awful. The kind of awful that make you feel sick.",2.0,25 May 2024
Not made in the mad max style.,So much CGI when all I wanted to see was amazing cars and real stunts. The CGI wasn't even that great and the amount of it that was used ruined it for me. And what was up with the sand pit from nowhere that sucked the guy in? Weird. The story and the acting was OK and it was nice to get a little bit of origin story about Furiosa bit it just didn't do it for me as far as a Mad Max file went. If they made it more In the style of Fury road or the originals where live stunts and acting was used I probably would have given it a better rating but I'll have to wait for the next iteration before my faith in the Saga is regained.,4.0,26 May 2024
Mediocre at best,,5.0,30 May 2024
Irrelevant Mad Max Saga ... without Max,"When Fury Road was released, it delivered by taking the Mad Max saga into a stratospheric level of action and practical effects. Despite the plot being one of the most linear for an actioner, it satisfied fans by both retaining Max's travails as part of the central plot, plus introducing Furiosa as the next butt kicking female action hero, worthy to stand alongside the likes of Ripley or Sara Conner. With that, it kicked the Mad Max universe into occupying a more ferocious gear. Sure, the wasteland remains the backdrop, but Fury Road's audacious action, monstrous vehicles and jaw dropping stunts, helped Max fans rejoice that their hero had found new life beyond the Mel Gibson years.

So, armed with six Oscars and a set of decent box office numbers for an R-rated fare, it seems fair game that, eight years later, George Miller returns with another chapter in the saga, in the form of Furiosa's origin story.

On account of how Miller had managed to elevate every release of the Mad Max saga into a higher experience, we have every right to expect Furiosa to do the same.

Alas, for there it falls apart.

Every other Mad Max instalment revved into high-octane action pretty much from the word 'go', without audiences needing to wait long intervals. That's not the case with Furiosa. Apart from a tame chase sequence at the beginning, which is a whimper when compared to the gargantuan action that defined other instalments, you need to wait bout 40-50 minutes before the familiar guzzoline-soaked engines kick into high gear. And when they do, it doesn't have anything we haven't seen before. Furiosa' action portion is more of a been there, done that.

Now, that itself is not a bad thing. The John Wick sequels too, offered pretty much the same in the shootout department. But JW retained interesting characters to color our experience along the way. Plus, every now and then, each JW sequel managed to introduce something novel in the action sections. Furious fails at this.

There are lengthy down - time moments in-between action scenes, filled with back stories and dialogues. At times, such moments are even filled with pseudo philosophical rhetoric, if only to help us feel more for the character. That's doesn't cut it for a series that has always maintained action at its core.

Even then, earlier Mad Maxes filled spaces in between the action, with colorful characters. Supporting characters had enough charm to make us drawn to them. I still remember the Feral Kid, the Gyro Captain, Aunty Entity, Humungus, Immortan Joe, Rectus (the Fury Road versions).

Hardly anyone from Furiosa registers. The younger Immortan and Rectus only occupy narrative space in the film, their parts made up of family meetings and snarling around. The role of the colorful character is left to Chris Helmsworth's Dementus, but his Dementus is a hodge podge of traits, and so, hard to pin down. He is over-the-top, has weird fashion sensibility (walks around with a teddy bear on his belt - what does that even mean??), cruel yet funny, visionary and yet foolish.

As for Anna Taylor, she may be a credible actress in other projects, but her Furiosa lacks the screen presence found in Gibson's, Hardy's and Theron's portrayal of their respective characters. And every other Mad Max series also stood on the shoulder of their lead's screen presence. This is therefore, not the right vehicle for Taylor, if she wants to venture off into actioners.

Furiosa also fails at its logic; for e.g. How does she continue to ride a bike with one arm in the wasteland, when she had just lost her other arm? Any other person would have died from blood loss. Why doesn't she speak a lot? I mean, is it a common trait in the Mad Max saga that its leads say very little? Was it necessary to have Tom Burke's Praetorian Jack as a Max look alike? At least, Burke's Jack seemed to provide some emotional connectivity that otherwise is near zilch elsewhere. But his role is too limited to elevate the rest of Furiosa.

The plot also fails ending to explain why Furiosa ends up hating Immortan Joe, when, for the most part of the movie, she seems to have settled into live at the Citadel.

Ultimately, the movie's feel can be summed up with Dementus' quote, when he asks Furiosa ""Do you have it in you to make it epic?""

Sadly, this is one Mad Max entry that couldn't.",5.0,28 May 2024
"Great story, great acting, poor visuals.","If you're going to see this film based off of the phenomenally breathtaking live action stunts filled with pyro technic and visually stunning backgrounds that ""Furry Road"" left audiences speechless with, then this is not the film for you.

George Miller is an amazing writer and filmmaker and his storytelling ability does not fault in any way during the film.

Sadly it seems he did not take as much risks with this film as he did with FR. The visuals feel cheap and the action feels slow. There was never a moment for the score to pick up in the way that it did in FR.

FR left audiences with and epic battle to the death with an incredible score to follow behind it making you quench the theater seat as chills rose up your spine, and sadly Furiosa never delivered those same feels.

I give it a 5 for great storytelling and great acting, but the visuals are lacking in a such a way that only makes one think... is George Miller just trying to make another boring Marvel/Star Wars/DC, style film franchise out of Mad Max? If that's the case then shame on you George Miller.",5.0,2 June 2024

Not a MAD MAX Movie without MAD MAX!,"What the audience wants is MAD MAX, Tom Hardy, back on the silver screen as the lead actor. How can you a MAD MAX Sage without MAD MAX? They took all the edited footage that was cut from Fury Road, dusted off all the props and wardrobes, hired a few new actors and actresses and made another film without MAD MAX. Anya Taylor-Joy has done very good work in the past, but she really not ready for a strong leading role. The director paraded her around the silver screen in unbelievable action shots that only a physically strong actor is capable of being imagined able to do. Anya is just too thin and thimble looking. Her body mass would be better at portraying a ballerina. The icing on the cake, or lack of it, comes from a terrible plot. Girl gets kidnapped and abused and then girl gets revenge, daa. You telling me they could not come up with something a little more creative! The outback landscape is a good metaphor for the plot of this movie, flat and dry. To save Hollywood, they need to focus on making movies with actors and actresses cast in parts that they can portray believably, hire good writers that can create complex interesting plots that give the actors some decent lines to recite.",5.0,27 May 2024

Some times it is just the time to stop and put an idea to rest but Hollywood can't think of anything new so they just keep rehashing the same story over and over and over.

Max deserved better!,"Was this a satire? It must have been. The two main actors, Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, did such a terrible job acting I can only assume we were meant to laugh. Such bad acting is not unknown, but in a George Miller picture it is unusual. There's a difference between ""over the top"" and ""simply bad."" Sometimes there's a thin line. Johnny Depp crosses it a lot lately, but good actors usually stay on one side. Taylor and Hemsworth cross the line completely.

All isn't terrible. Young Alyla Browne is a complete scene stealer and a film stealer. I haven't seen anyone like this since Natalie Portman in The Professional. Browne is captivating in everything she does, making Joy's acting embarrassing, to say the least.

There are more problems with the film. Miller doesn't seem to know how to end it, though I did like the final ending. And the continuity seems to get blurred at times, and the timeline itself is violated often.

Bottom line - a big disappointment. Mad Max deserved better.",3.0,29 May 2024
"Entertaining, but odd","Ok, it's worth seeing this film just for Hemsworth hamming it up. It's true to the Fury Road theme, and is certainly entertaining.

However, there's an oddness about this film (apart from Anya Taylor-Joy - who seems to rely on staring a lot), some of the visual effects were speeded up. Now, this may have been deliberate to make the film more comic-like, or it may have been a device to indicate time speeding, or it may just have been poor editing - but I found it irritating and distracting from the film. And, as well as this, the film (as with most releases at the moment) was over long and could have been 20 minutes shorter.

As I say at the start, this film is entertaining, just make sure you have a bit of food, stare back at Anya Taylor-Joy, and ignore the speeded up bits if you suffer from dizziness.",5.0,30 May 2024
NO MORE MAD MAX PLEASE!!!,"How can I express how awful this film is? So. Allow. Me to jump right in!! At first this film actually at the very beginning had promise with the storyline. Child, kidnapped and her heroic mother goes after the band of misfits and mayhem. Hemsworth looked like a Thor reject and seemly wanted to go into that character but remembered he was the actually villian. How sad. Joy actually gave a pretty decent performance. While mute during the majority of this awful film. Yes. Yes, it's the end of the world in Australia. And usually leaders are born. But, truly caught my attention was this. Leather and heat do not go together along with sand. No pun intended. If the world is going out like this film least push the red button now for a reset.",5.0,26 May 2024
A confusing mess,"This movie is genuinely awful, the storyline is all over the shop, It's very hard to get at all emotionally invested in any of the characters as we know so little about them and even if you try to lock in onto the movie and follow closely you'll still get lost.

I found myself drifting off and wanting the movie to end so I could move on, I gave the move a fair shot but it's all over the shop. The only place in which they succeeded is in the special effects, which were brilliant. The movie is near impossible to follow and feels like it was made for people with the attention span of a toddler. I would NOT recommend.",2.0,3 June 2024
Disappointed,"You expect each concurrent movie of director to be better than the previous. This is no the case. It's a washed down version of fury road, it lacks the tempo it lacks the stakes, it lacks the madness and quirkiness.

It looks somehow worse than the fury road, from the CGI (sometimes horrendously bad) to editing and camera work... Like it was made by someone other than Miller.

And most of all it checks all the boxes of ""prequelitis""...: 1. You know that every character not seen in fury road will die, and every one FROM fury road must live... So absolutely no stakes 2. Most of the movie gives you background for pointless stuff... Want to know how the cistern was build ? No ? Too bad you'll get 15 minutes about it, want to know why furiosa blackened her forehead? No, why would you? Too bad you'll get that too. And so on and on and on.

3. Has nothing to add story wise, just expands the lore which just plain boring.

Don't get me wrong it's an enjoyable movie, different than most of the others, acting is generally ok (aside for the Hemsworth posh accent ... What's with that ?), stunts are crazy, design is spot on. But it's just so much worse than fury road that it made me quite upset after living the cinema.",5.0,30 May 2024
Betrayed by budget and script rewrites???,"First of Alyla Browne deserved to be top billing along Anya and Chris because she is in half the movie playing a young Furiosa and she is great.

It's an action movie and there is plenty of good action but the movie still fails in that regard also. It fails because the movie and script sets the stage for one final epic action scene that never happens probably because of budget restrains and I suspect some script rewrites happen instead. With one final 20-30 action scene this would have been an amazing action movie finishing on a high note.

On the drama department there is a lack of new characters or even fleshed out ones apart from Chris Hemsworth's Dementus who surprisingly does amazing. Unfortunately his character is betrayed by the script as well. While he brings this character to life with great body language acting and simple stylish dialogue, he is given a monologue where the character reveals to us his thoughts and feeling but it doesn't work, because such a character embroiled in lunacy can't have self awareness, it's as if the writer is speaking to us not the character. It's a failure of the script that was likely rewritten and we get talking instead of amazing action at the very end.",5.0,30 May 2024

Mad Max without Max,"Fury Road was kind of okay, nothing special, and we only got glimpses of Mad Max occasionally. This time, Mad Max isn't even in it.

The Furiosa story isn't very interesting, and watching this felt like extending a 2-hour movie to at least 4 hours. Is it a bad movie? No, not at all-it's just not a typical Mad Max film. If you want a true Mad Max experience, rewatch the first three films. Even Fury Road doesn't quite fit the Mad Max mold. This movie isn't made for the fans, nor does it contribute anything essential to Max's story. It's a completely new story arc that no one asked for or wanted to watch, judging by the ticket sales. When I go to see a Mad Max movie, I expect Mad Max to be front and center-just like when I order popcorn in the lobby, I expect actual popcorn in the bucket, not something else I didn't ask for.

Overall, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" has received mixed reviews. Some appreciate its emotional storytelling, while others miss the iconic presence of Mad Max himself.

"Furiosa: A Soulless rehash of Fury Road, Disappointing with short stories and no connections","It's a feast of recycled characters, settings, and situations from the previous movie Fury Road, adapted without passion or mystery. Short stories that didn't need to be told are included, and a deep romance is crammed into 5 minutes, lasting no more than another 30 seconds. The chase scenes on the road sprang from nowhere without any connection, and the choreography reminded me of the group fight scenes from the 1966 Batman series, missing only the onomatopoeias of bam, swam, pum! Which would have at least made it more fun. They attempt to emulate short tragedies with characters given memorable screen time only to be killed off suddenly without relevance to the story. The lore about the new religious belief of the motorized became mere filler props in scenes. In this Mad Max, there is no barbarism, no tragedy, no main story arc, no despair. It's pure magical thinking materialized, short stories that seem like an anthology written by the same author in different phases of a creative crisis. Drunk, sleep-deprived, depressive, and drugged would be more accurate names for each section of the movie. The ending is rushed and empty; and Chris Hemsworth, he does well as the god of thunder, but he was nothing like the antagonist they tried to portrait, neither tragic, nor crazy, nor ruthless never felt any of it at any moment.

Disappointing,"They've been talking about doing this movie for years. So i was all up for it. But does it live up to the standards of the excellent ""fury road?"" Unfortunately i found alot of this movie to be stuck in first gear.

I'm maybe being too harsh with the rating because there are positives in the movie. Most of the action is as good as you'd expect with alot of real stunts, and Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as the villian. I loved the middle hour or so of it, and the film had alot of style and cool design work like all the Mad Max movies have had.

But there were just as many negatives. There wasn't really a plot and it was all very this scene, then that scene, then this, then that. I didn't know what was going on the first half hour or so, and then found the last half hour very underwhelming and anticlimatic.

Plus there was alot of bad green screen and CGI despite what people say. Can Chris Hemsworth not drive? Because he was just being dubbed into the truck he was in, and even the cracks in his windows were CGI. I mean come on! I get people being on fire being done with CGI but some of this was just lazy.

"Decent movie, completely ruined by an awful 2nd half","""Furiosa"" could have been an entirely watchable, action-packed movie if not for its last 30 minutes.

The film quickly grabs your attention by transporting you into the world of Mad Max, seen through the eyes of a young Furiosa. It peaks in the middle with her coming-of-age story but sharply declines in quality toward the climax.

Chris Hemsworth's presence is jarring throughout. His character's motivations are poorly explained, and he often seems to act merely to serve the plot.

Anya Taylor-Joy impresses with the limited screen time she has, but Alyla Browne and Charlee Fraser set a very high bar that the other actors struggle to reach.

The mention of the 40-day war feels like a throwaway detail, adding nothing to the plot. Major character deaths are glossed over, diminishing their impact.

The only down part for this movie, as I was reading the comments is, ""It is not the same as the Fury Road"". If you think a little. Is that really a problem? Because 99 out of 100 times it is a positive review. Trust me this movie is somewhere at Alien 1 and 2. Very great acting. Very great storytelling, literally Miller is building a character during a fight scene and doing it well ...Noone else is capeable for that.

Anya-Taylor Joy is not just a good Furiosa, but she can be Charlize Theron's Furiosa aswell. She brings her voice, her movements. Class.

Chris Hemsworth should play more bad guys, fits him too well.

The movie itself is great, gives you more vision of the Mad Max world. How the life goes for the poorest and the richest, you get it all.

Literally the only problem for me, that this movie should be 20 minutes longer and show the war at the end. I know that was a financial barrier for that, but studios should give Miller unlimited money.
