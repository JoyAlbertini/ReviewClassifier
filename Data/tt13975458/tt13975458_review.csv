one time watch.... if that,"I just returned from watching this movie. I was curious to see how it would compare to the original movie. The move followed the original fairly well, with a few exceptions. The cube kills were fairly uneventful. This day and age I expected something better. There was an odd sub story that detracted from the suspense of the cube and felt a little out of place The acting was below average...Give it a watch but the originals were better.",4,23 October 2021
A shadow of the original. Not very good.,"So the Japanese tried to remake the classic survival horror movie ""Cube"". They did a poor job of it. Not only are the characters annoying as hell, but they introduced some psychic connection with the cube and an occupant that was idiotic. Aside from the lack of interesting trap rooms, coherent characters and wired psychic reaction within the cube, there is really nothing worthwhile in this poorly conceived remake. If you are curious still, then give it a watch. I don't recommend this for fans of the original film. Until this stupid review character requirement is lifted you all will have to spend your time reading bloated reviews with no substance because we have to fill the last part of the review with this nonsense just to get it submitted now. We all need a new rating website. This one has gone in the dump.",3,7 September 2022
Numbism,"Back then, the first Cube movie was epic, exciting and a fine surprise, this remake is redundant and adds nothing really good or new to the original one. In every aspect inferior, well, the share of drama is big sized. Next.",3,15 March 2022

Totally unnecessary remake,"Well, I could write a long review about it, but the review title I've put up there says it all. So how I could reach 150 characters when there is really nothing else to say about that...",1,3 December 2021
Fails to improve on the original,"There's really no reason to see this film if you've seen the original. It's mostly the same plot, same mystery, and the same utterly unsatisfying ending that doesn't answer a single question you might have.",4,15 March 2022
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE!,"Let me start with this, Im adept to the Asian side or J horror side of movie production. I understand the long pondering looks the phrases or scenes that don't seem to make sense at the time but all done together at the end for a satisfying wtf moment that come only with superb narrative good visuals excellent storytelling.. Definitely not here! Can't give an Xtra star for the visual because the 97 version was just as striking and most likely cost less to make with little to no CGI? The filmmaker tried to invoke a life lesson but failed to make a good movie. Backstory on wrong character no story on strongest character this movie was All over the place! Some say it was better than later Cube additions I the series yes possibly, but this is labeled a remake. I was very excited seeing asian characters ready for an amazing take on this well known story among sci-fi horror fans.... So disappointed I believe it was green lit to grab the squid game crowd..even down to the greenish garment.... Lastly for those who liked it great!! But do yourself a favor seek out the 1997 version and you'll get a better understanding of my dissatisfaction plus see an awesome movie to boot!",1,25 April 2022

"Cube, as good as it ever was","This one is more of a ""Mystery, Drama"" as opposed to Cube (1997)'s ""Psychological Thriller"" status. These Cube films are all over the place in terms of genre and tone, so that's not a bad thing at all. I like the variety this franchise holds while somehow being as formulaic and repetitive as a Scooby-Doo film.

It also repeats a lot of the plot beats from the Cube (1997) film, that this is technically based on. The film has different characters that are different character archetypes than the original film too, which was nice to see. The characters rely less on their archetypes and more on their emotions, which made for an investing and riveting drama. This film stands alone and sets itself apart by changing so much about the characters, while keeping most of the plot beats of the original.

It's also almost 25 years after the original film's release, and VFX have advanced a lot since then. This film is able to fully replicate and in some places even surpass the effects of the original film. The gore is almost non-existent in this one, but the more mysterious and dramatic tone didn't leave me longing for gore. The cutaways to a CGI cube graphic was really annoying, but it added to the mystery, and it payed off, so i can't complain. This might actually have the most satisfying ending of any Cube franchise film, even though it leaves you on such a great hook for a sequel. One of my biggest gripes is these films' inconsistency with continuity and technology. I really hope this film gets a sequel directly following this film and is able to tie up its loose ends completely satisfactorily, for the first time in Cube (1997) history.

Keep in mind that i am an official member of the Cube (1997) appreciation society, so you should know i like me some Cube franchise media. I really enjoyed this film, but I don't think any of this Cube sequels surpass 3 stars.

Anyways, if you have a way to watch this, you should. It's a Cube film, you know what you're getting into.",6,17 June 2023
Waste of 90 minutes,"Being a fan of the original cube series, I expected this remake to add a bit more to the story or at least have some good twists and better effects. This is basically the same movie as the original cube with worse effects.",2,28 February 2022
"Don't expect it to copy the original. And no, it is not like the original.","For some reason reviewers on this site are adamant on remakes being ""faithful"" to the original. They want crazy CGI and super scary horror scenes (not that the original was scary at all... can we talk about that? People complain that the remake doesn't fit the horror genre when the original wasn't in the first place), but unfortunately for them, this movie doesn't deliver on that. It does, however, deliver on other fronts that actually make the movie a worthwhile watch, like more drama, better character development, a more interesting ending, etc. What bothers me the most is that people complain about the introduction of backstory that occurs outside the Cube when all it does is give more insight on a character's motivation. There was never a ""magic"" of only seeing the Cube in the first place, so don't pretend like it mattered.",8,2 January 2023
better than a 4.6,"This movie, although not better than the original, does deserve more than a 4.6 in my opinion. It has decent drama in terms of psychology, but the logic is sloppy or questionable at most.",6,14 March 2022
adds nothing,"I guess Japanese like the Drama, but its boring for us. No point for everything that happens, its not interesting, its like a normal movie not a cube one.",5,15 March 2022
Why? Just why?,"I'm a huge fan of the original cube, the idea I thought was epic. Bit less of the 2nd and cube zero but that's arguable. But this...is an abomination. Remake are lame but we reached a new low.

Character utterly stupid with cheap drama backstory that bring absolutely nothing to the story.

They could at least give us some good CGI and interesting trap (the main point of the film btw) but that was disappointing also

What's next? A Saw remake where the two people chained in the bathroom fall in love?",1,27 March 2022
Laaaaaaaame,"Such a poor remake! Nothing makes sense, not the puzzles, not the characters, not even the gory moments... Such a waste of time. I watch it until the end just to write this review and let you know that there isn't a good scene/sequence in the whole movie.

One dialogue before the final one is the only thing that have a little bit coherence to me... Besides that, the rest of the movie is pure bad acting, over stressed dialogues, not even the visuals within the Cube make sense. Can't imagine why the director got interested in doing something so boring.

It would be bearable if gore was the core object...",1,1 August 2023
The Japanese Version of the Cube,"This film begins with a man waking up and finding himself in a symmetrical room with an exit hatch on all four walls along with one on the floor and one on the ceiling. After choosing to go through one of the exists leading into a similar room, he accidentally triggers an unseen mechanism which results in square-shaped beams quickly protruding from one side of the room which kill him instantly. Then scene then shifts to another man waking up in a similar cube-shaped room and, after venturing from one room to the next, comes upon two other men and a boy who have found themselves in the same situation. Although none of them have any idea what they are doing in this place, one thing they do know is that some of the rooms they came upon were booby trapped. It's during this time that a female named ""Kai Asako"" (Anne Watanabe) joins them from an adjacent room during which time they all identify themselves. Not long afterward, they come upon an older man named ""Kazumasa Ando"" (Kotaro Yoshida) who initially believes that these 5 people have come to rescue him. Needless to say, he is quite disappointed to learn that they are also looking for a way out of this predicament as well--and the longer they remain in this environment the more hostile some of the people become. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this remake of the 1997 movie wasn't nearly as good due in large part to some rather bad overacting from some of the cast members. Ironically, although the plot was very similar to the original movie, it did have a twist at the end which I thought was somewhat better. That being said, while I don't consider this movie to be bad by any means, I firmly believe that the original was better, and I have rated this particular picture accordingly. Average.",5,28 January 2023
Easily the worst remake ever,"I have never seen a remake failed this much.

Everything that is great about the original is absent : the music, the tension and most importantly the philosophical conversations between the characters.

All this is replaced by a cheesy subplot that doesnt add anything to the story. Showing life outside the cube completely distroys the concept of the movie.

We don't know much about the characters either so it is difficult to understand the progression and there is zero subtility in the way the story is written and developped.

It's amazing they could make such a bad movie based on this cult classic.",1,11 December 2022
"If your sleeping pills not working, try this film","I dont really remember the first original one, but I started to watch this remake definitely because of the 1st one.... and yes, this is another master piece, master of crap!!! Never knew Japanese actors are so damn bad, or somehow they accidentally recruit all the worst actors in one movie.

I am begging everyone of you to go see your living room floor for 120 mins instead of this master crap.",1,4 August 2022
"Familiar, Yet enjoyable: A Review of the Japanese Adaptation of ""Cube""","If you have seen the first cube movie , this one should feel very familiar. I have to admit - it was still an enjoyable ride. This movie is still different enough to get a kick out of it. It has Japanese themes portrayed, like seniority, childhood drama, childhood vs adulthood. It has mystery elements, lowkey mathematical elements, but most of all interpersonal drama.

Don't expect a big budget and lots of effects. This one plays it safe. If you are a fan of these type of movies (actors trapped in a room e.g. The platform, Coherence, 12 angry men etc) I'd say give it a go.

In conclusion, the Japanese adaptation of ""Cube"" is an enjoyable ride for those who appreciate the original film and are fans of the genre. Although it plays it safe in some respects, the movie is different enough to keep viewers engaged and entertained. If you're a fan of suspenseful, character-driven films, give this one a go.",7,9 April 2023
Boring,"The original is one of my favorite movies. This remake is boring and the traps are just pointless and lacking. There was no need or reason for this movie to have been made.

The characters have no charisma and I did not care for them. Some of the characters aren't pivotal to the story at all. Until certain revelations at the very end.

The twist at the end just didn't work for me.

There was a lack with the characters and I just didn't care for any of them.

It was just uneventful and boring. The traps weren't anything special and I was expecting more.

I highly recommend those who have watched the original not to bother with this movie.",1,3 May 2023
Homage gold,"Horror and Science Fiction have combined successfully throughout the years to create some of the most iconic and original films in cinema. This would include seminal entries such as Alien (1979), The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986) and Event Horizon (1997). These productions were frequently based on earlier, acclaimed, literature and was produced with considerable, to enormous, budgets and raised vast amounts at the box office. In 1997, Vincenzo Natali wrote and directed Cube, which instantly became an influential and inspirational cult classic. The fact that the film was completed on a budget of $700 000, and resulted in a number of sequels, only highlights the effectiveness and originality of the storyline.

When Hollywood pounces on the ingenuity and profitability of a new production, it is inevitably and predictably remade, most often when a foreign, non-English language film, reaches cultural relevance and mainstream success, like Oldboy, The Ring (Ringu), 12 Monkeys (La Jetee) and The Departed (Infernal Affairs). But interestingly, the opposite happened when Japanese writer, Kôji Tokuo adapted Natali's script, to remake the 1997 Canadian/American original Cube in 2021.

A group of strangers wake up in mysterious room inscribed with an unfamiliar code. Looking for ways to escape, they discover the room is riddled with lethal traps. As fear and distrust swirl around them, the group must work together to survive and escape.

As Natali's original script was only adapted, mostly for modern Japanese audiences, there are limited changes from the 1997 film. The core concept of a group of strangers stuck in a mysterious box remains intact. Yasuhiko Shimizu does, however, include a few new creative flourishes and narrative adjustments and specifically adds distinct colours to differentiate between different cubes and traps as well as adding social commentary more reflective of Japanese culture, including ageism and technological dependence. The storyline flows in a more straightforward and traditional fashion as characters are clearly developed and their connections revealed in a rational and consistent manner. The viewer is made aware of how the clues and puzzles are resolved and this is one of the major improvements from the original film.

One of the biggest departures from the 1997 version, however, does create some distraction. Yuichi Goto (Masaki Suda) is the main protagonist, and his backstory is thoroughly explored through flashbacks of events outside of the Cube.

Although this development assists the audience in understanding his motivations better, it also breaks full immersion and dilutes the sense of claustrophobia and unnerving paranoia, which was such a large part of the original.

Shimizu's Cube retains many familiar beats from its predecessor, but adds enough psychological intensity and social conflict to create an interesting new product. The design of the traps rely heavily on CGI, but performances and sound production sells the tension and energy of each traumatic attempt as escape. Shimizu is clearly a fan of the original as he pays artful homage to the entire series, and lovingly touches on the mythology created. The pacing may be problematic for some, as Asian cinema often explores a more deliberate and languid progression, with a focus on the drama of each interaction and loss, leaving the vulgarity of gore, to be imagined and not witnessed.

The 1997 Cube may have been a precursor to torture porn (Saw, Hostel, The Collector), but the Japanese version aims for something more refined and analytical, and sticks the landing with a nuanced ending that is a clear, but delightful, departure from the original. Fans of the original may prefer the unnerving, chaotic 1997 version, but the fresh and stylised Cube 2023 is a fantastic addition to the cultural phenomenon and popularity of hard Sci-Fi Horror.",8,17 December 2023
Drama inside a Cube,"Well the original movie from 1997 had more mystery and action , this remake has more psychology and drama. I will say its nicely done, but left me somewhat empty, especially the ending, So i gave it a 7.",7,13 March 2022
Cubic Square no Brain Writer,"Why make a remake of a indie masterpiece and destroy everything that was briliant about it...

Terrible Script, copys many ideas from the original, but bad plot, poor actors, very bad pacing makes this movie a very boring experience... Even the traps on the rooms are lame in general.

The writers choose a terrible villain with terrible motivations, and the emotional parts of the movie with a particular character are weak at best.

It's the worst cube movie by far... The worst thing, is that japonese movies are usually gritty, gory and tense and this film is the complete oposite.

I Give a 3 out of 10.",3,26 August 2023
The copier is broken...,"Like others who have written reviews here, I'm a fan of the original. It had been a while since I'd seen it, so I was intrigued by this remake, I wanted to see what would be changed.

The answer is... nothing. Or at least nothing that improved on the original, which it seems to follow beat for beat. While I don't think it's done shot for shot, I was reminded of Gus van Sants Psycho remake. When I saw that, I felt growing horror (not the good kind) as I realized that, yes indeed, he really made it as close as the original as possible. Why do a remake of a great movie if you have nothing new to say? Remake a bad one.

So this version of Cube feels more like a copy, but slower, dumber, longer, and cheaper. When I watch a film in another language, I sometimes find it hard to evaluate the acting. Not so here - the acting is bad. The oldest actor appears to have some screen presence. Everyone else is sub par.

So if you're a curious fan like me, skip this and rewatch the original.",3,18 February 2024
Best of the Sequels,"The original Cube is one of my favorite films of all time. The mystery and mathematical design behind the cube is fascinating. Unfortunately, the sequels mostly fall flat by adding an unnecessary element and/or pulling back the curtain too much.

I somehow missed the release of this Japanese version until I saw a random online comment about it. I was disappointed to see the negative reviews, but never-the-less decided to give it a chance.

While it is essentially a remix of the original and not perfect, I enjoyed it. I think it is better than the previous sequels. The production quality is generally on par with the original film.

The characters could be more interesting and there are a few too many slow melodramatic stares. It also has less gore, but I am personally more interested in the survival and story aspects.

The film is fortunately not an exact copy of the original. The cube, characters, and interactions are somewhat different. There are similarities for sure, but it is the same situation and it is to be expected.

Rather than a remake, perhaps this Japanese version should be viewed as a story about another group in different cube in Asia (a Cube Cinematic Universe if you will). If Cube fans go into it with that mindset, I think they will enjoy it.",7,26 May 2022
Better than expected,"I'm a bit puzzled why this is so low rated. I can only conclude people are mostly racist, because i found this every bit as enjoyable as the original. Yes, this is a remake of the cult hit, but although the story is very much the same, the execution is very different, (no pun intended).

For those of you who may not have seen the original and don't know the plot already, it is about a group of strangers that wake up in a maze of rooms filled with various fatal traps. If you have seen the original, i would advise not comparing them. Here's why... The original was a gory, unique story with lots of mystery and surprise. This has less mystery, but just as much suspense and a lot better character focus, which i liked.

Oh and for those saying the acting was poor, i think they were drunk, because the acting was fantastic in places IMO.

So although nothing ground breaking, still an enjoyable time that if it weren't for the original and the myriad of escape room type movies since, i think this would have been a lot better received.

A last thought, of you do watch it, make sure to stick around for the mid credits scene, it adds a nice twist the first film didn't have.",7,11 August 2023
Hip to be square,"Or something along those lines - no pun intended of course. It has been a while since I last saw the original Cube movie. I really have to do a rewatch - sooner than later. But I thought I would give this (late) remake from Japan. So while I don't remember all the twists (I did remember the number stuff), maybe it helped liking this a bit more than most have liked it.

I can see that people have issues with this. It does not seem to add much to the original concept. On the other hand it is supposed to be a remake and not a reinvention ... at least that's how I understood it. That said, the acting is ok - the twists work most of the time. Though you may question a lot of things ... the ending tries to explain a few things - not sure if it works for anyone ... that's for you to decide.",6,1 November 2023
yall are tweakin,"This movie is honestly one of my favorites of all time. Its super underrated and has a cast i love a lot. I grew attached to every character and any/all deaths impacted me. The twist is immaculate and while yes it is a remake, that doesn't take away the experience. While not necessarily 'scary' that doesn't mean it didn't fill me with suspense when the characters would be in dangerous situations. This is the first movie that made me speak out loud in fear for my favorite character, which is saying something because i usually react silently. The low rating is honestly so bizarre to me, i recommended this movie greatly. Its a 10/10.",10,23 April 2023
Unnecessary but not terrible,"Like many other reviewers my main question for this movie is why was it made? I don't think anyone asked for this and the movie does not manage to improve the franchise and doesn't come close to the original. However I have to say that the rating and the reviews are rather harsh. I don't think this movie was terrible and in fact I thought it was enjoyable at times. On the other hand I knew in the back of my head there there was this absolutely awesome 1997 movie that was perfect just the way it was and that dragged down my watching experience for this remake. Remakes are rarely wanted but can occasionally make sense, but for Cube it was not the case. But like I said I didn't think it was terrible and if you desire to see more Cube content then this is a solid though unnecessary watch overall. [6,1/10]",6,26 February 2024
"One of the Best Written, Acted Thrillers","I watched this movie a few nights ago and did not know anything about it. It was excellent. Solid story about 6 strangers - 3 men, 1 woman, 1 older man, 1 13-year old boy - who awake trapped inside a large cube-like space with branching doorways. Choose the wrong one, and you die. Their only hope of survival is to stick together. So intelligently written, with solid performances from all the actors. One of the best movies I've seen in the past couple years. Highly recommend if you like eerie suspense/thrillers. Director and crew are very talented. I hope it makes a ton of money in the digital universe!",10,18 April 2024
